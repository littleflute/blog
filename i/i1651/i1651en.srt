1
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:16,726
What would make me quit my job
during the pandemic?

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,101
The short answer: injustice in America.

3
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:22,476
But since I have a little time,
let me give you the long version.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,059
In May 2020, protests broke out
across the United States.

5
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,851
George Floyd, a Minnesota man,

6
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:31,018
was killed by a couple
of police officers on camera

7
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:34,393
and hundreds of thousands
of Americans had had enough.

8
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:37,601
Like so many others,
I watched the protests on the news.

9
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,643
I watched as the crowd moved
from downtown Atlanta to Buckhead,

10
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:41,934
where I live.

11
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,143
The protesters were right
outside of my house,

12
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:45,934
so in true millennial fashion,

13
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,976
I took out my phone so I could
record it and post it to Twitter.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,226
After logging the events,
I called my parents,

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,184
and as I was talking to my snook,
which is what I call my mom,

16
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,809
I began to get a little worried.

17
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,559
The energy of the crowd was growing

18
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:59,809
and snook told me, "Don't worry, baby,

19
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,101
when people feel
that their voices aren't heard,

20
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,458
they have to make it felt."

21
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:05,417
Hm.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,018
They have to make it felt.

23
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:12,018
That statement hit me hard because,
why weren't people being heard?

24
00:01:12,042 --> 00:01:14,226
I mean, if we're all watching
the same thing,

25
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,309
then why aren't we all upset?

26
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,226
And how could I help make a difference?

27
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,434
No, better yet, how could I make it felt?

28
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:25,167
That was the moment I began
to think about opting out ...

29
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:29,976
opting out of a career
I dreamed of my entire life.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,893
I've been playing in the WNBA since 2009,

31
00:01:32,917 --> 00:01:35,851
most recently as a guard
for the Atlanta Dream.

32
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:38,518
Basketball has been one
of the biggest parts of my life,

33
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:40,125
and yet I decided to give it up,

34
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:43,958
trying to focus on changing
the world for the better.

35
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:47,601
I wanted to make it felt.

36
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:51,393
Some people thought I was crazy,
but honestly, most people got it,

37
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:54,018
and even though I was filled with fear,

38
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:56,643
I took that leap of faith
and did it anyway.

39
00:01:56,667 --> 00:02:00,726
I opted out not knowing
how I was going to pay my bills.

40
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,643
I opted out not knowing

41
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:06,143
if I would ever be
a professional WNBA player again.

42
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,768
I opted out of my comfort zone,

43
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:10,393
and in doing so, I truly opted in.

44
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:12,476
I gained a completely
different perspective

45
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,351
and the confidence that comes
with turning moments into momentum.

46
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,434
The next day I threw a Juneteenth event,

47
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:21,893
and Juneteenth is a day to commemorate
the official end of slavery.

48
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:24,851
At the event, people were telling me
they heard my story,

49
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:28,434
they were coming up to me like,
"Yo, you opted out! That's so dope!"

50
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,559
But then they began to vent to me,

51
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,309
telling me about uncles
pulled over for no reason,

52
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,643
cousins killed by the police.

53
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:39,393
They wanted me to know their stories
so I could represent their voices,

54
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:41,101
and in that moment,

55
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,726
I felt so connected with helping them.

56
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,768
They felt that I was the person
that could make their stories felt,

57
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,434
and honestly,

58
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,476
I was committed to doing
whatever I needed to make that happen.

59
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,559
I don't know how to cure racism,
fix police brutality

60
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,976
or any of the other problems
plaguing America.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,601
No one person can do that.

62
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,351
But we all can do
what we can to make it felt.

63
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,684
Making it felt for me is an action.

64
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,309
It's not just protesting
and raising your voice,

65
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,268
but also doing something
to show your intention.

66
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:12,934
I opted out and now you feel me.

67
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,893
Honestly, that was a big move for me,

68
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:16,851
but now that I've done it,

69
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,976
it feels like it was almost inevitable.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,684
And while making it felt
can have a negative connotation

71
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,643
of violence and trouble,

72
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:27,268
I wanted to show that it could
also have a really positive form.

73
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:29,684
Playing in the WNBA
has afforded me a platform,

74
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,518
and with that platform,
I want to create positive change.

75
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:33,809
So big picture,

76
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,476
I want to level the playing field

77
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,226
so that everyone has access
to the same opportunities,

78
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,559
regardless of race.

79
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,893
To do this I know I need
to increase exposure

80
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,643
to the young Black and brown youth,

81
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,851
showing them explosive fields like tech

82
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,934
and creating ways for them
to develop those skills

83
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,768
so they can seize the opportunities.

84
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:52,101
We're creating a workshop

85
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,018
and partnering with organizations
already doing the work,

86
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,351
taking small steps now

87
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,661
that I know will have
a big impact in the future.

88
00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:01,268
A lot of times we underestimate
what we can do --

89
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:03,226
the effect we can have.

90
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,559
Imagine if we all started to think
about "How can I make it felt?"

91
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:11,476
If we all took that leap of faith
to stand for what we believe is right,

92
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,018
regardless of the very real fear
embedded in that decision,

93
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:18,851
I think we would then start to fulfill
the title of the United States of America

94
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,851
instead of the divided states
that we're seeing right now.

95
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:25,726
I know from basketball
that all it takes is a single moment,

96
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,143
a second, to change everything.

97
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,393
So let's choose to turn
our moments into momentum.

98
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:32,726
I'm making it felt,

99
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,393
are you?

100
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:35,667
Thank you.
