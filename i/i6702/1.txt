I am here to sign a document betting $10,000
00:03
that my last video is in fact, correct.
00:07
This is the video in question.
00:10
Some people may have missed it,
00:11
but in this car, there is no motor, no batteries,
00:15
no energy source, besides the wind itself.
00:18
And the counterintuitive claim,
00:19
is that this car can maintain speeds
00:22
faster than the wind that's pushing it.
00:25
There is a physics professor at UCLA,
00:28
who got in touch, to say that he thought that I was wrong,
00:31
that the explanation was wrong.
00:33
You know, we went back and forth a little bit,
00:35
and eventually I said,
00:36
"Well, how about we bet $10,000?
00:40
"I can prove it to you.
00:41
"This vehicle really can go downwind faster than the wind."
00:45
And to my surprise, he is taking me up on the bet.
00:48
- Look, no one is perfect,
00:50
but you have a much lower error rate
00:53
than most people on YouTube, in YouTube Space.
00:56
- Now, Professor Alex Kusenko wanted this wager
00:59
and all related discourse to be public.
01:01
In fact, he suggested we get a celebrity
01:03
to witness the signing.
01:04
So I asked Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye,
01:06
and Sean Carroll to be our witnesses.
01:08
And they graciously agreed.
01:10
- And Alex, I just wanna say,
01:12
I agree with everything you said about Veritasium.
01:15
That generally I can watch it
01:18
and not have to wonder, is he gonna mess up?
01:21
How am I gonna-
01:22
- No, he's brilliant, no, he's brilliant.
01:24
- I'm excited about this bet,
01:25
because if I am wrong, then I wanna know.
01:28
Like the whole point of the channel is to get to the truth.
01:31
And that is, I think why we're all here today.
01:33
And I think, you know,
01:34
this is a great chance to sort of see.
01:36
I'm going to summarize Alex's main points in this video,
01:39
but I'll put his full presentation here.
01:41
- So let me first explain what I see in the video.
01:46
In the video, the vehicle is operated in a gusty wind.
01:50
Initially, you have the wind speed exceeding the car speed,
01:55
but then the wind speed is not constant.
01:57
The wind speed drops, and the car moves by inertia
02:01
with deceleration for awhile.
02:03
- So, basically Alex thinks a gust
02:05
pushes the car to a high speed.
02:07
And then when the wind dies,
02:08
the car is going faster than the wind momentarily,
02:11
but it must be slowing down.
02:13
- In fact, that will be my conclusion
02:14
at the end of this presentation,
02:16
that whenever you have velocity faster than the wind,
02:18
I'll actually show you in an equation,
02:20
the acceleration is negative.
02:22
The second effect is that the wind in the video
02:26
is measured at the height
02:28
of about a meter or a meter and a half.
02:30
But the propeller goes to some three meters
02:32
above the ground.
02:33
- Now, due to interactions with the ground,
02:35
there is a wind gradient.
02:37
Wind travels slower, close to the ground,
02:39
and then faster, higher up.
02:41
Now, Alex estimated that the wind speed of the propeller
02:43
might be 10 or 15% higher than at the tell-tale.
02:47
So it's possible that the car could be moving
02:49
slower than the wind at the propeller,
02:51
and yet appear to be moving faster than the wind
02:53
at the height of the tell-tale.
02:55
- Now, I think that this is a small effect.
02:57
However, in combination with the previous effect,
03:00
it just can make this more frequent, okay.
03:03
And that completes-
03:04
- Alex, if I remember the video correctly,
03:07
Derek reports that they've achieved
03:09
up to 2.8 times wind speed.
03:12
That feels much higher than what is possible here,
03:17
unless the wind had picked up
03:19
and then spontaneously sort of dropped.
03:21
- Very, very good question.
03:22
Okay, if you're going for the record,
03:25
you probably will do many attempts.
03:27
You will be sampling that gusty wind
03:29
over, and over, and over,
03:32
until you set the record, right?
03:33
That's how you set the record.
03:34
And on one of those occasions,
03:37
you will get a nice strong gust,
03:39
which is three times the air that comes after it, okay?
03:43
And that's when you will clock the record.
03:45
And that's where that 2.8 factor will come in.
03:48
- So what about the treadmill tests?
03:50
These are conducted in still air.
03:53
By moving the ground backwards,
03:55
you're simulating a perfectly steady tailwind.
03:58
And if you hold the car stationary on the treadmill,
04:01
well, that's equivalent to the car going exactly wind speed.
04:05
Now, if the car can move forward on the treadmill,
04:08
that shows it can accelerate faster than the wind.
04:13
But Alex had multiple explanations,
04:14
why these experiments don't actually show
04:17
what they claim to show.
04:19
- If you have this fluctuating speed of the treadmill,
04:24
and then if a human just sort of steers it,
04:27
it then can introduce unconsciously,
04:29
a bias towards the desired result.
04:31
- So, would it any be that the guy with the spork
04:35
is inducing the model craft
04:38
to go across the lane now and then?
04:40
And as you pointed out, I would go downhill now and then.
04:44
- Yeah, I'm sure, I'm a hundred percent sure
04:47
that the guy in the video doesn't do it on purpose, okay.
04:53
However, you know, if he is expecting forward drift-
04:57
- Yeah, oh he's trying.
04:58
- Yeah, yeah absolutely, that's exactly, okay,
05:01
so there you go.
05:02
- In the absence of convincing experimental evidence,
05:05
Alex turned to theoretical analyses,
05:08
like one by MIT Aero Professor, Mark Drela.
05:11
But here too, he found problems.
05:14
His main concern is that the equation for net force
05:16
includes the difference between the speeds of the car
05:19
and the wind in the denominator.
05:21
Which seems to imply that when traveling exactly wind speed,
05:25
you should get infinite force.
05:27
- Now, here's the real danger.
05:29
Because if Derek drives very close to the wind,
05:33
that difference in speed goes to zero.
05:36
If it's one millionth of one percent,
05:39
that's like a nuclear bomb exploding behind him.
05:41
Then Derek is definitely in trouble, right?
05:43
So we need to find something to save Derek's life here.
05:46
This is serious, right?
05:48
- But dividing by zero, come on, you guys.
05:50
I never looked at that.
05:51
- [Derek] Alex performed his own analysis,
05:54
and found no such divide by zero problems.
05:57
In fact, he found there's no way for the car
06:00
to accelerate at, or above wind speed.
06:03
- The acceleration of this craft is negative.
06:06
So when we, you know,
06:08
so it's possible to move the craft faster than the wind,
06:10
but it's not possible to move it at zero acceleration
06:13
which would be needed to maintain constant speed.
06:16
- [Derek] That is basically where we left it.
06:18
- That is right.
06:19
- Okay, thank you, thank you, Neil.
06:20
Thank you very much.
06:21
- Thanks guys, thanks Neil.
06:22
- So now it was up to me to convince Professor Kusenko
06:25
that Blackbird really can go faster than the wind,
06:31
When I posted about it on Twitter,
06:33
Alice Zhang, who runs Chinese Veritasium, said,
06:35
"I think you lost Derek.
06:37
I'm 80% on Alex's side now."
06:40
What's amazing to me, is that neither one of them
06:41
had seen my attempts to replicate the treadmill experiments.
06:45
For the first video, I asked my friend and YouTube maker,
06:47
Xyla Foxlin, to make a model downwind cart.
06:50
- All right. (wheels screeching)
06:52
(laughing)
06:54
- [Man] Oh, no!
06:55
- Version one ended in failure,
06:57
but Xyla was undeterred,
06:59
coming back in a couple of days with version two.
07:01
- Is it feeling like it's gonna...?
07:03
- Unlike these models, most of her projects actually work.
07:06
She is determined.
07:08
So maybe this tells us something
07:10
about whether you can
07:11
actually go faster than the wind, downwind.
07:14
What was clear to me is that I didn't do a good enough job
07:17
in the first video, explaining how Blackbird works
07:20
and providing convincing evidence
07:21
that it can really go faster than the wind
07:24
in a sustained way.
07:25
In my defense, I thought the concept
07:27
was well enough established.
07:29
Way back in 1969, Andrew Bauer
07:31
build the first successful downwind cart.
07:34
And he did it to settle a friendly wager
07:37
with Aero Engineer, Apolo Smith.
07:39
The bet was inspired by a claim in a students paper
07:42
from 20 years earlier.
07:44
Now, Rick Cavallaro, the builder of Blackbird
07:45
was completely unaware of all this
07:47
until after he built his cart.
07:49
But other analysis have been published
07:51
under names like the push-me pull-you boat.
07:54
So I didn't honestly think anyone would doubt
07:56
the vehicles operation, much less bet me $10,000.
08:00
But clearly, there is a need for a deeper explanation.
08:04
So I want to do that now by responding to the points
08:06
Alex raised.
08:07
So first, let's deal with wind gradient.
08:10
I mean, why didn't we measure
08:11
the speed of the wind higher up?
08:12
Well, the answer is because it's already been done.
08:16
They mounted tell-tales on fishing poles
08:18
out to the sides of the propeller and even above it.
08:21
Now, although the lowest tell-tale flips back first,
08:23
all of the tell-tales do eventually flip backwards
08:27
showing that every part of the vehicle
08:28
is going faster than the wind.
08:31
Could this be because of a big wind gust
08:33
that pushed the car up to high speed and then the wind died?
08:36
I don't think so.
08:38
Even though I didn't have a speedometer in the car
08:40
for my runs, someone on Twitter pointed out
08:42
that we could use the rotation of the back wheel
08:45
to determine the speed from the video footage.
08:47
This shows that even after the tell-tale flips backwards,
08:50
the car keeps accelerating.
08:54
Another thing I want to point out is that,
08:55
if wind gradient or gusts
08:57
were the reason that the car travels faster than the wind,
09:00
well, you'd expect the tell-tale to jump around
09:02
or at least not point straight back at me.
09:05
But it consistently does for over 30 seconds
09:08
until I had to hit the brakes
09:09
to avoid crashing into parked vehicles.
09:12
But if that's not enough for you,
09:13
when Blackbird achieved its record speed
09:15
of 27.7 miles per hour in a 10 mile per hour tail wind,
09:20
it was still accelerating.
09:22
And we know this because
09:23
there were multiple GPS units in the car and wind speeds
09:27
which were measured at the height of the propeller
09:29
at multiple locations.
09:31
The highlighted section shows
09:32
the ten second measurement period
09:34
over which the record was set.
09:36
Also in 2013, the U.S Physics Olympiad Semifinal Exam
09:40
asked questions about Blackbird.
09:42
Like, can it go faster than the wind downwind and upwind?
09:47
The solution says, both modes are possible.
09:50
And with sufficiently low energy loss,
09:52
any speed is possible.
09:55
Now, I'll admit that the evidence
09:57
I showed in the first video was not definitive
09:59
when gusts or gradients
10:01
could have explained the observations.
10:04
But now that you've seen this evidence,
10:06
are you convinced that Blackbird can go downwind
10:08
faster than the wind without slowing down?
10:11
Well, Professor Kusenko was not convinced.
10:14
So I wanna explain how the car works so clearly
10:17
that no one, not even the professor,
10:19
can doubt what's going on.
10:21
The first thing to know,
10:22
is that the propeller doesn't work like most people think.
10:25
It's not working like a windmill.
10:26
It doesn't turn the way the tailwind is pushing it.
10:30
Instead, it turns in the opposite direction,
10:32
working like a fan to push air backwards.
10:35
This fan is powered by the wheels,
10:37
which are connected to the propeller by a bike chain.
10:40
So at wind speed, the car can keep accelerating
10:42
because the wheels turn the fan, which blows air back,
10:46
generating forward thrust.
10:48
Now the big question is, to drive the fan,
10:50
there must be a backwards force on the wheels,
10:53
which tends to slow them down.
10:55
So why isn't this force bigger
10:57
than the thrust from the propeller
10:59
causing the car to slow down overall?
11:01
Well, the answer is,
11:03
the wheels are going so much faster over the ground
11:06
than the propeller is moving through the air.
11:08
So the thrust force can actually be larger.
11:10
I'm gonna do an analysis
11:12
in the frame of reference of the car.
11:14
And the important equation to know is,
11:16
power equals force times velocity.
11:18
So at the wheels, power is input into the system
11:21
by the ground moving underneath the car.
11:24
The power generated is the force of the ground on the wheels
11:27
times the velocity of the car.
11:30
At the propeller, work is done on the air,
11:33
as the propeller pushes it backwards.
11:35
The power out equals the force of the prop on the air,
11:38
times the speed of the car, minus the speed of the wind.
11:42
The prop is going slower through the air
11:44
due to the tailwind.
11:46
And if we assume no losses,
11:47
then the power in at the wheels,
11:49
equals the power out at the propeller.
11:51
From this equation,
11:52
we can see that the force at the propeller
11:54
will be greater than the force at the wheels.
11:58
And since the propeller is pushing air back,
12:00
the air applies an equal and opposite force
12:03
forward on the prop.
12:05
This is the thrust force, which will be greater
12:07
than the backwards force on the wheels.
12:12
So, this car works like a lever or a pulley
12:15
by applying a small force to the wheels
12:17
over a larger distance,
12:19
the propeller can apply a larger force
12:22
over a smaller distance.
12:24
This is just like when you're riding a bike going up hill,
12:27
you move the pedals fast, but with smaller force,
12:30
to make the wheels move slower over the ground,
12:32
but with a bigger force.
12:35
But now we've run into the divide by zero problem,
12:37
that Professor Kusenko warned us about.
12:40
When the speed of the car
12:41
is exactly equal to the speed of the wind,
12:43
it seems like the propeller can provide infinite force.
12:46
That can't be right, can it?
12:48
I mean, is our analysis flawed?
12:50
The answer is no, for two reasons.
12:53
First of all, this is exactly what you'd expect
12:56
theoretically, with any lever or pulley.
12:58
If one arm of the lever is zero,
13:00
then you can lift an infinite weight
13:03
with any amount of force on the other side.
13:05
The catch is, it's displacement will be zero.
13:08
But second of all, in practice,
13:10
there is a propeller efficiency term
13:12
that is ill-defined
13:13
when the propeller is not moving through the air.
13:15
- There's a better formula for the prop proficiency,
13:18
which is well-defined in the zero speed limit.
13:21
It makes an algebraic mess,
13:23
but it's perfectly well-defined.
13:25
- And then the divide by zero problem is eliminated.
13:28
But that equation makes the problem
13:30
look more complicated than it actually is.
13:32
You don't actually need aerodynamics.
13:35
Here, I have a little cart with a big wheel
13:37
that rolls on two smaller spools.
13:40
And what I'm gonna show
13:41
is that when you have two media
13:44
moving relative to one another,
13:46
well then if this car is in contact with both media,
13:49
it can actually move faster than their relative velocity.
13:55
So as I push the board to the right,
13:59
you can see that the car goes down the board
14:02
faster than the board is moving.
14:06
If you look carefully,
14:07
you'll see that the big wheel
14:08
isn't turning the way that the board is pushing it.
14:13
It's actually rotating in the opposite direction.
14:16
That's just like the propeller on Blackbird,
14:18
which pushes back against the air,
14:21
and that's how it's able to go faster
14:24
than the wind downwind.
14:26
Now you can build one of these cars for yourself at home,
14:29
or you can build a model downwind cart.
14:34
I told you, Xyla was determined.
14:35
Yeah, I'm gonna make the claim on camera.
14:37
I like, I think it's gonna work this time.
14:40
We're changing the propeller.
14:41
- It has to work
14:42
before we get kicked out of the treadmill store. (laughing)
14:44
(motors roaring)
14:53
(chuckling)
14:55
- [Derek] Does it work?
14:56
- It totally works.
14:57
- [Derek] Amazing.
14:58
- Oh my god, it's so good.
15:01
- Her fourth version of the cart works spectacularly
15:04
and it was designed to be replicated by anyone
15:07
using just a 3D printer and a simple list of materials.
15:10
She explains how to build it with more detail
15:12
on the engineering process
15:13
on a video over on her channel.
15:15
So go check it out.
15:16
Now, professor Kusenko has now conceded the bet,
15:20
and he transferred $10,000 to me.
15:22
So I wanna thank him for being a man of honor,
15:24
and changing his mind in light of the evidence I presented,
15:28
which is really not easy to do,
15:29
especially in a public debate like this one.
15:32
Now I do not wanna keep the money.
15:34
I wanna invest it in science communication.
15:37
So I'm holding a one-minute video competition.
15:40
I'll be awarding cash prizes to the top three videos
15:44
that explain a counterintuitive STEM concept.
15:47
I'll put some details down in the description.
15:50
What I love about science,
15:52
is that disagreements are not problems.
15:55
They are opportunities for everyone to learn something.
15:58
I learned a lot more about Blackbird aerodynamics,
16:02
and gear ratios than I knew before.
16:04
I also learned
16:05
that I should go into more depth in my videos.
16:07
I should make the evidence overwhelmingly convincing
16:09
and put in some equations toward the end
16:11
for those who want that level of detail.
16:13
I wanna thank everyone involved in the making this video.
16:16
Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, Sean Carroll, Mark Drela,
16:19
Professor Kusenko and Xyla Foxlin,
16:22
but especially Rick Cavallaro,
16:24
the inventor and creator of Blackbird.
16:26
He was a fountain of information,
16:28
a constant source of support,
16:30
and the man leading the charge to help people understand
16:32
this area of physics for the past 15 years.
16:35
Let's hope this video puts the issue to rest
16:38
once and for all.
16:40
(electronics buzzing)
16:43
The Blackbird craft all started with a brain teaser.
16:46
And this video sponsor, Brilliant,
16:48
offers you a daily problem to solve every day,
16:51
like this one about gear ratios.
16:53
If the first gear spins 10 times per second,
16:55
at what rate does the final gear spin?
16:57
Now I did this problem the hard way,
16:59
but my wife figured out how to do it the easy way.
17:01
And that's what brain teasers are great for.
17:03
They get you thinking about the world,
17:05
and they give you insights into problems
17:07
you might think you already understand.
17:09
Just think about
17:10
how much more you would understand in a year,
17:12
if you got into the habit
17:14
of solving one novel unexpected problem per day.
17:17
And while you're at it,
17:18
why not take one of Brilliant's courses,
17:20
like on computer science, neural networks,
17:22
or classical physics.
17:23
