00:00:12,669 --> 00:00:14,730
Imagine you're on a shopping trip.

3
00:00:14,754 --> 00:00:18,239
You've been looking
for a luxury-line dinnerware set

4
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:20,016
to add to your kitchen collection.

5
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:21,730
As it turns out,

6
00:00:21,754 --> 00:00:24,511
your local department store
has announced a sale

7
00:00:24,535 --> 00:00:27,004
on the very set you've been looking for,

8
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:31,378
so you rush to the store
to find a 24-piece set on sale.

9
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:35,541
Eight dinner plates,
all in good condition;

10
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:38,604
eight soup and salad bowls,
all in good condition;

11
00:00:38,628 --> 00:00:41,588
and eight dessert plates,
all in good condition.

12
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:44,007
Now, consider for a moment

13
00:00:44,031 --> 00:00:46,894
how much you would be willing to pay
for this dinnerware set.

14
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:50,503
Now imagine an alternate scenario.

15
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:53,597
Not having seen this 24-piece luxury set,

16
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:57,918
you rush to the store to find
a 40-piece dinnerware set on sale.

17
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,955
Eight dinner plates,
all in good condition;

18
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:03,603
eight soup and salad bowls,
all in good condition;

19
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:06,161
eight dessert plates,
all in good condition;

20
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:09,303
eight cups, two of them are broken;

21
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:12,327
eight saucers, seven of them are broken.

22
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:14,716
Now consider for a moment

23
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,051
how much you would be willing to pay
for this 40-piece dinnerware set.

24
00:01:19,086 --> 00:01:24,339
This is the premise of a clever
experiment by Christopher Hsee

25
00:01:24,363 --> 00:01:26,261
from the University of Chicago.

26
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:30,165
It's also the question that I've asked
hundreds of students in my classroom.

27
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,960
What were their responses?

28
00:01:34,352 --> 00:01:37,845
On average, when afforded
the 24-piece luxury set,

29
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:41,460
they were willing to spend
390 pounds for the set.

30
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:45,023
When afforded the 40-piece dinnerware set,

31
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:50,506
on average, they were willing
to spend a whopping 192 pounds

32
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,690
for this dinnerware set.

33
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,563
Strictly speaking, these are
an irrational set of numbers.

34
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,294
You'll notice the 40-piece dinnerware set

35
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:03,460
includes all elements
you would get in the 24-piece set,

36
00:02:03,484 --> 00:02:05,952
plus six cups and one saucer.

37
00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:10,677
And not only are you not willing to spend
what you will for the 24-piece set,

38
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:15,621
you're only willing to spend roughly half
of what you will for that 24-piece set.

39
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,612
What you're witnessing here

40
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:21,764
is what's referred
to as the dilution effect.

41
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:25,112
The broken items, if you will,

42
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:29,731
dilute our overall perceived value
of that entire set.

43
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:35,564
Turns out this cognitive quirk
at the checkout counter

44
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,492
has important implications

45
00:02:37,516 --> 00:02:42,469
for our ability to be heard
and listened to when we speak up.

46
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:46,652
Whether you are speaking up
against a failing strategy,

47
00:02:46,676 --> 00:02:51,688
speaking against the grain
of a shared opinion among friends

48
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:54,669
or speaking truth to power,

49
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:56,240
this takes courage.

50
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,883
Often, the points that are raised

51
00:02:59,907 --> 00:03:03,294
are both legitimate
but also shared by others.

52
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,597
But sadly, and far too often,

53
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:10,565
we see people speak up
but fail to influence others

54
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:12,429
in the way that they had hoped for.

55
00:03:14,121 --> 00:03:15,399
Put another way,

56
00:03:15,423 --> 00:03:17,852
their message was sound,

57
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:20,308
but their delivery proved faulty.

58
00:03:21,173 --> 00:03:23,872
If we could understand
this cognitive bias,

59
00:03:23,896 --> 00:03:26,220
it holds important implications

60
00:03:26,244 --> 00:03:29,874
for how we could craft
and mold our messages

61
00:03:29,898 --> 00:03:33,308
to have the impact we all desire ...

62
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:35,969
to be more influential as a communicator.

63
00:03:37,232 --> 00:03:39,746
Let's exit the aisles
of the shopping center

64
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:45,995
and enter a context in which we practice
almost automatically every day:

65
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,891
the judgment of others.

66
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,544
Let me introduce you to two individuals.

67
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:55,996
Tim studies 31 hours a week
outside of class.

68
00:03:57,388 --> 00:04:02,738
Tom, like Tim, also spends 31 hours
outside of class studying.

69
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:05,394
He has a brother and two sisters,

70
00:04:05,418 --> 00:04:07,182
he visits his grandparents,

71
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,668
he once went on a blind date,

72
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:11,737
plays pool every two months.

73
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:15,652
When participants are asked to evaluate

74
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:18,590
the cognitive aptitude
of these individuals,

75
00:04:18,614 --> 00:04:21,606
or more importantly,
their scholastic achievement,

76
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,179
on average, people rate Tim

77
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:27,893
to have a significantly higher
GPA than that of Tom.

78
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:30,280
But why?

79
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:34,382
After all, both of them spend
31 hours a week outside of class.

80
00:04:35,823 --> 00:04:38,189
Turns out in these contexts,

81
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:41,021
when we're presented such information,

82
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:45,402
our minds utilize
two categories of information:

83
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,272
diagnostic and nondiagnostic.

84
00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:53,491
Diagnostic information
is information of relevance

85
00:04:53,515 --> 00:04:55,619
to the valuation that is being made.

86
00:04:56,603 --> 00:05:01,376
Nondiagnostic is information
that is irrelevant or inconsequential

87
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,763
to that valuation.

88
00:05:03,358 --> 00:05:06,945
And when both categories
of information are mixed,

89
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:08,413
dilution occurs.

90
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:12,290
The very fact that Tom
has a brother and two sisters

91
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:15,604
or plays pool every two months

92
00:05:15,628 --> 00:05:19,548
dilutes the diagnostic information,

93
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:20,856
or more importantly,

94
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,065
dilutes the value and weight
of that diagnostic information,

95
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:29,241
namely that he studies
31 hours a week outside of class.

96
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,365
The most robust psychological explanation
for this is one of averaging.

97
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:38,467
In this model, we take in information,

98
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:42,141
and those information
are afforded a weighted score.

99
00:05:43,055 --> 00:05:46,999
And our minds do not add
those pieces of information,

100
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:50,622
but rather average
those pieces of information.

101
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:56,668
So when you introduce irrelevant
or even weak arguments,

102
00:05:56,692 --> 00:05:59,072
those weak arguments, if you will,

103
00:05:59,096 --> 00:06:02,365
reduce the weight
of your overall argument.

104
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,441
A few years ago,

105
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,324
I landed in Philadelphia
one August evening

106
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:09,738
for a conference.

107
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:12,821
Having just gotten off
a transatlantic flight,

108
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:15,774
I checked into my hotel room,
put my feet up

109
00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:19,173
and decided to distract
my jet lag with some TV.

110
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,529
An ad caught my attention.

111
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:26,588
The ad was an ad
for a pharmaceutical drug.

112
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:33,837
Now if you're the select few who've not
had the pleasure of witnessing these ads,

113
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,741
the typical architecture of these ads

114
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:40,631
is you might see a happy couple
prancing through their garden,

115
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:44,078
reveling in the joy that they got
a full night's sleep

116
00:06:44,102 --> 00:06:45,963
with the aid of the sleep drug.

117
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,002
Because of FDA regulations,

118
00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:54,423
the last few seconds of this one-minute ad
needs to be devoted to the side effects

119
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,038
of that drug.

120
00:06:56,062 --> 00:07:01,150
And what you'll typically hear
is a hurried voice-over that blurts out

121
00:07:01,174 --> 00:07:04,587
"Side effects include
heart attack, stroke,

122
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:07,048
blah, blah, blah,"

123
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:09,829
and will end with something
like "itchy feet."

124
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:11,834
(Laughter)

125
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:14,927
Guess what "itchy feet" does
to people's risk assessment

126
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:16,580
of "heart attack" and "stroke"?

127
00:07:17,523 --> 00:07:19,092
It dilutes it.

128
00:07:19,116 --> 00:07:21,545
Imagine for a moment
an alternate commercial

129
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:24,653
that says "This drug
cures your sleep problems,

130
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:27,583
side effects are heart attack and stroke."

131
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:29,614
Stop.

132
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,580
Now all of a sudden you're thinking,
"I don't mind staying up all night."

133
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:36,140
(Laughter)

134
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:39,512
Turns out going to sleep is important,

135
00:07:39,536 --> 00:07:41,408
but so is waking up.

136
00:07:41,432 --> 00:07:44,077
(Laughter)

137
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:47,674
Let me give you
a sample from our research.

138
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:53,046
So this ad that I witnessed
essentially triggered a research project

139
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,022
with my PhD student, Hemant,
over the next two years.

140
00:07:56,732 --> 00:07:58,538
And in one of these studies,

141
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:03,087
we presented participants
an actual print ad

142
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:04,849
that appeared in a magazine.

143
00:08:04,873 --> 00:08:06,539
[Soothing rest for mind and body.]

144
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:11,016
You'll notice the last line
is devoted to the side effects

145
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,197
of this drug.

146
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,297
For half of the participants,

147
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:17,392
we showed the ad in its entirety,

148
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:21,852
which included both major side effects
as well as minor side effects.

149
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,839
To the other half of the participants,

150
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:28,732
we showed the same ad
with one small modification:

151
00:08:28,756 --> 00:08:32,170
we extracted just four words
out of the sea of text.

152
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:36,078
Specifically, we extracted
the minor side effects.

153
00:08:36,623 --> 00:08:41,419
And then both sets of participants
rated that drug.

154
00:08:42,191 --> 00:08:45,303
What we find is that individuals
who were exposed

155
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:49,244
to both the major side effects
as well as the minor side effects

156
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:53,059
rated the drug's overall severity
to be significantly lower

157
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,302
than those who were only exposed
to the major side effects.

158
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:59,528
Furthermore, they also showed
greater attraction

159
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:01,349
towards consuming this drug.

160
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,160
In a follow-up study,

161
00:09:03,184 --> 00:09:06,155
we even find that individuals
are willing to pay more

162
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:09,009
to buy the drug which they were exposed to

163
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:12,399
that had both major side effects
as well as minor side effects,

164
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:15,031
compared to just major side effects alone.

165
00:09:15,717 --> 00:09:18,963
So it turns out pharmaceutical ads,

166
00:09:18,987 --> 00:09:23,404
by listing both major side effects
as well as minor side effects,

167
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:28,421
paradoxically dilute participants'
and potential consumers'

168
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:30,754
overall risk assessment of that drug.

169
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:33,906
Going beyond shopping expeditions,

170
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:39,739
going beyond the evaluation
of the scholastic aptitude of others,

171
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:43,376
and beyond evaluating risk
in our environment,

172
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,835
what this body of research tells us

173
00:09:45,859 --> 00:09:50,664
is that in the world of communicating
for the purposes of influence,

174
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:53,680
quality trumps quantity.

175
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,554
By increasing the number of arguments,

176
00:09:57,578 --> 00:09:59,498
you do not strengthen your case,

177
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:01,985
but rather you actively weaken it.

178
00:10:03,322 --> 00:10:04,473
Put another way,

179
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:07,394
you cannot increase
the quality of an argument

180
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:10,748
by simply increasing
the quantity of your argument.

181
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:15,242
The next time you want
to speak up in a meeting,

182
00:10:16,173 --> 00:10:22,332
speak in favor of a government legislation
that you're deeply passionate about,

183
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:27,555
or simply want to help a friend
see the world through a different lens,

184
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:29,373
it is important to note

185
00:10:29,397 --> 00:10:34,128
that the delivery of your message
is every bit as important as its content.

186
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,985
Stick to your strong arguments,

187
00:10:39,113 --> 00:10:43,604
because your arguments don't add up
in the minds of the receiver,

188
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:45,093
they average out.

189
00:10:45,707 --> 00:10:46,858
Thank you.

190
00:10:46,882 --> 00:10:49,222
(Applause)
