00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:33,333
music ...

4
00:00:38,256 --> 00:00:40,895
1,2,3,4

5
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:50,928
music ...

6
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:53,427
music ...

7
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:04,523
In the summer that I was baptized

8
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:09,533
My father held me to his side

9
00:01:09,713 --> 00:01:15,052
As they put me into the water<br>

10
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:19,869
He said how on that day I cried

11
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:22,797
We were prisoners of love,

12
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:25,097
 a love in chains

13
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:27,526
He was standin' in the door, 

14
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:30,025
I was standin' in the rain

15
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:35,313
With the same hot blood burning in our veins

16
00:01:35,432 --> 00:01:38,581
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

17
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:40,800
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

18
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,443
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

19
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:45,942
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

20
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:49,450
All of the old faces

21
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:54,570
Asked you why you're back

22
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:58,317
They fit you with position

23
00:01:59,456 --> 00:02:05,767
And the keys to your daddy's Cadillac

24
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:10,564
In the darkness of your room<br>Your mother calls you by your true name

25
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:15,412
You remember the faces, the places, the names

26
00:02:15,572 --> 00:02:17,601
You know it's never over, 

27
00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:20,700
it's relentless as the rain

28
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:23,646
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

29
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:26,146
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

30
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,646
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

31
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:31,146
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

32
00:02:31,346 --> 00:02:42,235
solo ...

33
00:02:42,435 --> 00:02:44,735
solo ...

34
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:47,235
solo ...

35
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:56,443
solo ...

36
00:02:56,641 --> 00:03:08,400
solo ...

37
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:19,950
solo...

38
00:03:20,249 --> 00:03:32,414
solo ...

39
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:44,339
solo ...

40
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:55,577
solo ...

41
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:17,777
solo ...

42
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:29,654
Yeah ...

43
00:04:30,993 --> 00:04:36,131
In the Bible Cain slew Abel

44
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:41,508
And East of Eden mama he was cast

45
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:45,565
You're born into this life paying

46
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:51,115
For the sins of somebody else's past

47
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:53,739
Well Daddy worked his whole life

48
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:56,329
 for nothing but the pain

49
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,889
Now he walks these empty rooms

50
00:04:58,987 --> 00:05:01,416
 looking for something to blame

51
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:06,283
You inherit the sins, you inherit the flames

52
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:09,411
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

53
00:05:09,463 --> 00:05:11,763
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

54
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:14,172
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

55
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:16,593
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

56
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:18,721
Lost but not forgotten,

57
00:05:18,882 --> 00:05:21,182
 from the dark heart of a dream

58
00:05:21,302 --> 00:05:24,260
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

59
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,680
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

60
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,808
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

61
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:31,192
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

62
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:36,011
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh

63
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:41,409
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh

64
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:46,368
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh

65
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,039
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh

66
00:05:51,278 --> 00:05:56,086
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh

67
00:05:56,286 --> 00:06:01,184
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh

68
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:06,122
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh

69
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:10,772
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh

70
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:22,899
solo...
