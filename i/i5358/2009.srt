music ...

00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:30,962
1,2,3,4

00:00:31,194 --> 00:00:41,027
music ...

00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:49,585
music ...

8
00:00:49,896 --> 00:00:53,985
In the summer that I was baptized

9
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:59,212
My father held me to his side

10
00:00:59,612 --> 00:01:04,261
As they put me into the water<br>

11
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:08,949
He said how on that day I cried

12
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:11,607
We were prisoners of love,

13
00:01:11,677 --> 00:01:13,827
 a love in chains

14
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:16,236
He was standin' in the door, 

15
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:18,625
I was standin' in the rain

16
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:23,662
With the same hot blood burning in our veins

17
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:26,871
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

18
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:29,080
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

19
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:31,462
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

20
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:33,892
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,390
All of the old faces

22
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,229
Asked you why you're back

23
00:01:43,748 --> 00:01:47,296
They fit you with position

24
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:52,954
And the keys to your daddy's Cadillac

25
00:01:53,074 --> 00:01:57,833
In the darkness of your room<br>Your mother calls you by your true name

26
00:01:57,893 --> 00:02:02,642
You remember the faces, the places, the names

27
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:04,810
You know it's never over, 

28
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,426
it's relentless as the rain

29
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:10,436
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

30
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,806
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

31
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:15,176
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

32
00:02:15,286 --> 00:02:17,586
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

33
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:28,515
solo ...

34
00:02:42,435 --> 00:02:44,735
solo ...

35
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:47,235
solo ...

36
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:56,443
solo ...

37
00:02:56,641 --> 00:03:08,400
solo ...

38
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:19,950
solo...

39
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:26,806
solo ...

40
00:03:27,014 --> 00:03:33,803
Yeah ...

41
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:38,291
In the Bible Cain slew Abel

42
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:44,431
And East of Eden mama he was cast

43
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:47,438
You're born into this life paying

44
00:03:47,637 --> 00:03:52,255
For the sins of somebody else's past

45
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:56,156
Well Daddy worked his whole life

46
00:03:56,222 --> 00:03:58,376
 for nothing but the pain

47
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:00,627
Now he walks these empty rooms

48
00:04:00,746 --> 00:04:03,045
 looking for something to blame

49
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:08,184
You inherit the sins, you inherit the flames

50
00:04:08,383 --> 00:04:11,261
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

51
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,760
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

52
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,259
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

53
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:18,097
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

54
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:20,459
Lost but not forgotten,

55
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:22,798
 from the dark heart of a dream

56
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:26,005
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

57
00:04:26,187 --> 00:04:28,487
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

58
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:30,987
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

59
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,875
Adam raised a Cain (yeah)

60
00:04:32,937 --> 00:04:37,525
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh

61
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:42,505
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh

62
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:52,275
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh

63
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:47,395
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh

64
00:04:52,406 --> 00:04:56,814
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh

65
00:04:57,014 --> 00:05:01,864
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh

66
00:05:02,062 --> 00:05:06,949
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh

67
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:11,870
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
