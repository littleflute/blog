00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,370
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone. Welcome to today’s Authors
at Google event. After the talk, we’re going

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,509
to have a Q and A session, and I’d like
to remind everyone to please use the microphone

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:14,349
in the middle of the room, if you have questions.
It’s my pleasure to introduce Christopher

4
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:20,779
Hitchens. Mr. Hitchens was born in England,
and educated at Oxford. In 1981, he migrated

5
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:26,190
to the US, and recently, became a US citizen.
He’s the author of a number of notable books

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:31,070
including “Why Orwell Matters” and “Letters
to a Young Contrarian.” As one of our most

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,880
notable public intellectuals, he has been
a columnist at “Vanity Fair”, “The Atlantic,”

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,150
“The Nation,” “Slate” and “Free
Inquiry,” and taught at the New School,

9
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:45,969
UC Berkeley, and the University of Pittsburgh.
In his new book, “God Is Not Great,” he

10
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:51,989
lines up the case against religion which he
spent a lifetime developing with anger, humor

11
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,050
and a formidable style of argument that defines
all of Mr. Hitchens’s work. About the book,

12
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,359
Michael Kinsley wrote in the New York Times,
“Hitchens has outfoxed the Hitchens watchers

13
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,770
by writing a serious and deeply-thought book,
totally consistent with his beliefs of the

14
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:11,140
lifetime. And God should be flattered; unlike
most of those clamoring for his attention,

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,630
Hitchens treats him like an adult. Ever contrarian,
and always eloquent, he’s here today to

16
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,110
discuss the book, take your questions, and
take on anyone who dares to challenge him

17
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,450
to a debate. He’ll be signing books afterwards.
And, with that, please join me in welcoming

18
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:37,231
Christopher Hitchens to Google.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Thank you, darling. Sweet. Well,

19
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:43,830
thank you so much for that suspiciously grudging
introduction. And thank you very much, ladies

20
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:49,710
and gentlemen, for coming. I understand we’ve
only got the balance of an hour together so,

21
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:57,860
I’ll try and break the rule of a lifetime
and be terse. I think I’ll put it like this.

22
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:06,140
It’s true that publishers sometimes want
to put a catchy or suggestive or challenging

23
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:13,709
title, subtitle on a book. And so, when we
hit upon or they hit upon, well, how religion

24
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:19,230
poisons and why religion poisons everything,
I knew what would happen, people would come

25
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,430
up to me, they'd say, you mean absolutely
everything, you mean the whole thing? They’d

26
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,459
take me literally. I thought, well, all right.
One of the things you have to do in life as

27
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:33,090
an author is live up to your damn subtitle.
So, today, I’d defend the subtitle because

28
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,950
I think the title probably, when it came to
me in the shower, I realized, it pretty much

29
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:44,709
does speak for itself. Unlike that sign outside
Little Rock airport, huge--we had a black

30
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:52,469
sign that you see from the airport that says,
just "Jesus," a word I have used myself, and

31
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:56,340
a name I know but putting it like that seems
to say both too much and too little, you know

32
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:04,569
what I mean? Well, here’s how religion has
this effect, in my opinion: It is derived

33
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:10,939
from the childhood of our species, from the
bawling, fearful period of infancy. It comes

34
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:15,710
from the time when we did not know that we
lived on an orb. We thought we lived on a

35
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:24,221
disc. And we did not know that we went around
the sun or that the sky was not a dome, when

36
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:29,439
we didn’t know that there was a germ theory
to explain disease, and innumerable theories

37
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:35,709
for the explanation of things like famine.
It comes from a time when we had no good answers,

38
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:41,110
but because we are pattern-seeking animals,
a good thing about us, and because we will

39
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:47,840
prefer even a conspiracy theory or junk theory
to no theory at all, a bad thing about us.

40
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,359
This is and was our first attempt of philosophy,
just as in some ways, it was our first attempt

41
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:57,810
at science, and it was all founded on and
remains founded on a complete misapprehension

42
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,340
about the origins, first of the universe,
and, second, about human nature. We now know

43
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,819
a great deal about the origins of the universe,
and a great deal about our own nature. I just

44
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:13,230
had my DNA sequenced by National Geographic.
You should all by the way get this done. It’s

45
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,030
incredibly important to find out how racism
and creationism would be abolished by this

46
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,830
extraordinary scientific breakthrough, how
you can find out your kinship with all your

47
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:29,380
fellow creatures originating in Africa; but
also, your kinship with other forms of life

48
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,830
including not just animal but plant, and you
get an idea of how you are part of nature,

49
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:41,060
and how that’s wonderful enough. And we
know from Stephen Hawking and from any others,

50
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,320
Steven Weinberg and many other great physicists,
an enormous amount now about what Professor

51
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,260
Weinberg's brilliant book calls The First
Three Minutes, the concept of the Big Bang.

52
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:58,630
And we can be assured as we could probably
need be that neither this enormous explosion

53
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,810
that set the universe in motion, which is
still moving away from us in a great rate

54
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:09,870
nor this amazingly complex billion dollar--billion
year period of evolution--we can be pretty

55
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,850
certain it was not designed so that you and
I could be meeting in this room. We are not

56
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,500
the objects of either of these plans. These
plans don’t know we’re here. I’m sorry

57
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,900
to say, wouldn’t know or care if we stopped
being here. We have to face this alone with

58
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,350
the equipment, intellectual and moral, that
we’ve been given, or that we've acquired

59
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:36,330
or that is innate to us. And here’s another
way in which religion poisons matters. It

60
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,620
begins by saying, well, why don't we lie to
ourselves instead, why don’t we pretend

61
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,530
that we’re not going to die, or that an
exception to be made at least in our own case

62
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:55,940
if we make the right propitiations or the
right moves. Why do we not pretend that the

63
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:03,190
things like modern diseases which we can sequence
now, sequence the genes of, like AIDS, are

64
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:08,530
the punishment for wickedness and fornication?
Why don't we keep fooling ourselves that there

65
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:13,780
is a divine superintendent of all this because
it would abolish the feeling of loneliness

66
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,460
and possibly even irrelevance that we might
otherwise--in other words, why don’t we

67
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,270
surrender to wish thinking? That poisons everything,
in my opinion. Right away, it attacks the

68
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:28,930
very basic integrity that we need to conduct
the scrupulous inquiries, investigations,

69
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:34,400
experiments, interrogations of evidence that
we need to survive, and to prosper and to

70
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,990
grow. And it's no coincidence, no accident
that almost every scientific advance has been

71
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,430
made in the teeth of religious opposition
of one form or another that says we shouldn’t

72
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,870
be tampering with God’s design. I suppose
the most recent and most dangerous one of

73
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,500
these is the attempt to limit stem cell research.
But everyone could probably think of all other

74
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:00,110
forms of scientific research and inquiry,
especially medical that had led to religious

75
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:05,620
persecution, in reprisal. Thirdly, it’s
an attack, I think, on what’s also very

76
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,390
important to us, our innate morality. If there’s
one point that I get made more than another

77
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:16,310
to me when I go and debate religious people,
it's this: They say, where would your morals

78
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:23,540
come from if there was no God? It’s actually--it’s
a question that’s posed in Dostoyevsky's

79
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,660
wonderful novel, The Brothers Karamazov, one
of the brothers says--Snelyakov, actually,

80
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:35,420
the wicked one, says it. If God is dead, isn’t
everything permitted, isn’t everything permissible?

81
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,060
Where would our ethics be if there was no
superintending duty? This, again, seems to

82
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:45,310
me a very profound insult to us in our very
deepest nature and character. It is not the

83
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:51,860
case, I submit to you, that we do not set
about butchering and raping and thieving from

84
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,300
each other right now only because we’re
afraid of a divine punishment or because we’re

85
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,450
looking for a divine reward. It's an extraordinarily
base and insulting thing to say to people.

86
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:07,780
On my mother’s side, some of my ancestry
is Jewish. I don’t happen to believe the

87
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,410
story of Moses and Egypt or the exile or the
wandering and the Sinai. And in fact, now

88
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:17,010
even Israeli archaeology has shown that there
isn’t a word of truth to that story or really

89
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:22,330
any of the others; but take it to be true.
Am I expected to believe my mother’s ancestors

90
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,990
got all the way to Mount Sinai, quite a trek,
under the impression until they got there

91
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:33,099
that rape, murder, perjury, and theft were
okay, only to be told when they got to the

92
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:38,729
foot of Mount Sinai, bad news, none of these
things are kosher at all. They’re all forbidden.

93
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:45,170
I don’t think so. I think, I think we can--actually,
I have a better explanation ever since--superior

94
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:50,410
as well as better--that no one would have
been able to get as far as Mount Sinai or

95
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,720
any other mountain or in any other direction
unless they had known that human solidarity

96
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:02,499
demands that we look upon each other as brothers
and sisters, and that we forbid activities

97
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:08,860
such as murder, rape, perjury, and theft.
This is innate in us. If those activities

98
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,750
are not innate, the sociopaths who don't understand
the needs of anyone but themselves and the

99
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:19,199
psychopaths who positively take pleasure in
breaking these rules, well, all we can say

100
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:24,980
is, according to one theory, they are also
made in the image of God which makes the image

101
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,509
of God question rather problematic, does it
not or that they can be explained by a further

102
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:33,699
and better research and have to be restrained
and disciplined meanwhile, but in no sense

103
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:42,410
here is religion a help where it came to help
most which is to our morality, to our ethics.

104
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:48,050
Finally, I would say--not finally because
I’m finished here, I’m not quite done.

105
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:55,009
Don't relax. Everyone has got to drink, something
to eat, but on the poison question, I think

106
00:09:55,009 --> 00:10:01,949
there’s the real temptation of something
very poisonous to human society and human

107
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:09,370
relations which is the fear of freedom, the
wish to be slaves, the wish to be told what

108
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:15,610
to do. Now, just as we all like to think and
we live under written documents and proclamations

109
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:21,809
that encourage us to think that it is our
birth right and our most precious need to

110
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:27,960
be free, to be liberated, to be untrammeled.
So we also knew that unfortunately the innate

111
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,230
in people is the servile, is the wish to be
told what to do, is the adoration for strong

112
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:41,220
and brutal and cruel leaders, that this other
baser element of the human makeup has to be

113
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:47,019
accounted for and it gives us a great deal
of trouble around the world as we speak. Religion,

114
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:53,540
in my view, is a reification, a distillation
of this wish to be a serf, to be a slave.

115
00:10:53,540 --> 00:11:01,759
Ask yourself if you really wish it was true
that there was a celestial dictatorship that

116
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,480
watched over you from the moment you were
born, actually the moment you were conceived,

117
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,300
all through life, night and day, knew your
thoughts, waking and sleeping, could in fact

118
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,829
convict you of thought crime, the absolute--the
absolute definition of a dictatorship, can

119
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:21,930
convict you for what you think or what you
privately want, what you’re talking about

120
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:27,990
to yourself, that admonishes you like this
under permanent surveillance, control and

121
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,749
supervision and doesn’t even let go of you
when you’re dead because that’s when the

122
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:39,519
real fun begins. Now, my question is this--my
question is this, who wishes that that were

123
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,370
true? Who wants to live the life of a serf
in a celestial North Korea? I’ve been to

124
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:50,619
North Korea. I’m one of the very few writers
who has. I’m indeed the only writer who’s

125
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:55,720
been to all three axis of evil countries,
Iran, Iraq and North Korea. And I can tell

126
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,740
you North Korea is the most religious state
I’ve ever been to. I used to wonder when

127
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,769
I was a kid, what would it be like praising
God and thanking him all day and all night?

128
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:08,589
Well, now I know because North Korea is a
completely worshipful state. It's set up only

129
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:13,540
to do that, for adoration and it’s only
one short of a trinity. They have a father

130
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,290
and the son, as you know, the Dear Leader
and the Great Leader. The father is still

131
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:24,180
the president of the country. He’s been
dead for 15 years, but Kim Jong-il, the little

132
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:30,180
one, is only the head of the party and the
Army. His father is still the president, head

133
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:36,949
of the state. So you have in North Korea what
you might call a necrocracy or what I also--I

134
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:43,459
called them mausolocracy, thanatocracy. One--just
one short of a trinity; father, son, maybe

135
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:49,079
no holy ghost, but they do say that when the
birth of the younger one took place, the birds

136
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:56,069
of Korea sang in Korean to mark the occasion.
This I’ve checked. It did not happen. Take

137
00:12:56,069 --> 00:13:01,779
my word for it. It didn't occur and I suppose
I should add they don’t threaten to follow

138
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:07,230
you after you're dead. You can leave North
Korea. You can get out of their hell and their

139
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:13,829
paradise by dying. To the Christian and Muslim
one, you cannot. This is the wish to be a

140
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:20,790
slave. And in my point of view, it’s poisonous
of human relations. Now, I’ve really babbled

141
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:27,129
for nearly twenty minutes. I’ll be quick.
It is argued, well, some religious people

142
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:33,220
have done great things and have been motivated
to do so by their faith; the most cited case

143
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,839
in point I have found is that of Dr. Martin
Luther King, who I know I don’t need to

144
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,829
explain to you about. Two quick things on
that: First, he was it’s true a minister.

145
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:49,750
He did preach the Book of Exodus, the exile
of an enslaved and oppressed people as his

146
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,699
metaphor. But if he really meant it, he would
have said that the oppressed people, as the

147
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:59,139
Book of Exodus finds them doing, were entitled
to kill anyone who stood on their way and

148
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:05,259
take their land and their property, enslave
their women or kill their children, and commit

149
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:13,410
genocide, rape, ethnic cleansing and forcible
theft of land. That’s what Exodus described

150
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,869
as happening--the full destruction of the
tribes. It's very fortunate that Dr. King

151
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:22,850
only the meant the Bible at the most to be
used as a metaphor and after all he was using

152
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:27,161
the only book that he could be sure his audience
has ever already read. That’s the first

153
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:32,680
thing. The second is, during his lifetime,
he was attacked all the time for having too

154
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,910
many secular and leftist non-believing friends,
the people like famous black secularists like

155
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:44,350
Bayard Rustin, A. Philip Randolph. These are
the men that did organize the march on Washington;

156
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,279
which leads me to my third observation which
is this: It’s a challenge I made now in

157
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:56,209
debates with rabbis, with priests of all Christian
stripes, with imams. Once--I know this sounds

158
00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:01,119
like an opening of a joke about some bar,
but once also with a Buddhist nun in Miami.

159
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:06,369
I asked them all. Here is my--here is my challenge.
You have to name me an ethical statement that

160
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:14,000
was made or a moral action that was performed
by a religious person in the name of faith

161
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,689
that could not have been made as an action
or uttered as a statement by non--a person

162
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:25,480
not of faith, a person of no faith. You have
to do that. Not so far and I’ve dealt at

163
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,429
quite a high level with the religious, no
takers. No one has been able to find me that.

164
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:34,649
That being the case, we're entitled to say,
I think, that religious faith serve as the

165
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:40,459
requirements whereas if I was to ask anyone
in this room, think of a wicked thing said

166
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:45,569
or an evil thing done by a person of faith
in the name of faith, no one would have a

167
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:50,940
second of hesitation in thinking of one, would
they? It's interesting to realize how true

168
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:56,050
that is and how much true it's getting. Does
anyone ever listen to Dennis Prager’s Show?

169
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:05,249
He’s a slightly loopy Christian broadcaster,
religious broadcaster, I should say. He’s

170
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:09,559
more Jewish than Christian--Judaic-Christian
broadcaster who quite often rather generously

171
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:12,819
has me on the show. And he asked me a question
the other day; he had a challenge of his own.

172
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:17,120
He said, “You are to imagine that you’re
in a town late at night where you have never

173
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,329
been before, and you have no friends and it’s
getting dark. And through the darkness, you

174
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:28,009
see coming towards you a group of men, let’s
say ten. Do you feel better or worse if you

175
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:36,300
know that they’re just coming from a prayer
meeting?” This is Mr. Prager’s question

176
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,199
to me. I said, “Well, Mr. Prager, without
leaving you, from just without quitting the

177
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:49,420
letter B, I can tell you I’ve had that experience
in Belfast, in Beirut, in Baghdad, in Bombay,

178
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:54,249
in Bosnia, and in Bethlehem. And if you see
anyone coming from a religious gathering,

179
00:16:54,249 --> 00:17:02,069
in any of those places, you know exactly how
fast you need to run. And no one has to explain

180
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:05,949
to you why and I haven’t had to waste any
time telling you, have I, ladies and gentlemen?

181
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:09,309
So I submit to you that it is those who are
people of faith who have the explaining to

182
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:14,470
do, who have the justifying to do if this
is indeed the case. If they can't account

183
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:20,769
for anything about the origin of our cosmos
or our species, if they say that without them,

184
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:26,510
we’d be without morals and make us seem
as if we are merely animals without faith,

185
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:32,450
if further, everybody can name an instance
where religion has made people actually behave

186
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:38,340
worse to one another and act as a retardant
upon the advances of knowledge and science

187
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,770
and information, I submit that the case to
be made is theirs rather than mine. We have

188
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:49,240
a better tradition. We’re not just arid
secularists and materialists, we on the atheist

189
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:56,880
side. We can point, through the Hubble telescope,
the fantastic, awe-inspiring majestic pictures

190
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,100
that are being taken now of the outer limits
of our universe, and who’s going to turn

191
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:08,510
away from those pictures and start gaping
again at the burning bush? We have smaller

192
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:13,130
microscopes that can examine for us the miracles
of the interior of the double helix and the

193
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:18,049
sheer beauty of that. The natural world is
wonderful enough, more wonderful than anything

194
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:25,080
conjured by the fools who believe in astrology
or the supernatural. And we have a better

195
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:33,269
tradition politically against the popes and
the imams and the witch doctors and the divine

196
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:39,540
right of kings and the whole long tradition
of civic repression combined with religion

197
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:44,809
that's known as theocracy. We have created
in the United States, the only country in

198
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:52,110
the history of the world, written on founding
documents testable, organized, works in progress

199
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:57,041
based on the theory of human liberation and
the only constitution in the history of world

200
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:03,740
that says that there shall be a separation
between the church and the state. God is never

201
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:09,420
mentioned in the United States Constitution
except in order to limit religion and keep

202
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:15,799
it out of politics and put it under legal
control. This achievement was described by

203
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:21,260
President Jefferson whose biographer, I am
in a small way, to the Baptists of Danbury,

204
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,420
Connecticut in a letter after they reasoned
him for fear of persecution. By the way, who

205
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:30,850
do you think Baptists of Danbury, Connecticut
were afraid of being persecuted by? Anyone

206
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,190
knows?
MALE: The Methodists?

207
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:37,630
HITCHENS: No, the Congregationalists of Danbury,
Connecticut. People forget what it used to

208
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:42,990
be like, see how the Christians loved each
other, how they tried to repeat the European

209
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:48,000
passion of one religious sect repressing and
torturing another one. And as you probably

210
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
know, the president wrote back and saud, “No,
you may be assured that there will ever be

211
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,019
in this country a wall of separation between
the church and the state.” So I have a new

212
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:01,309
slogan and I’m taking it on tour and I invite
you to join me in it and it goes like this,

213
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:17,620
“Mr. Jefferson, build up that wall.” Okay,
thank you very much for coming.

214
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:23,090
And I’m all yours. And that was 25 minutes;
I hope that’s fair. And I’ll point out

215
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,860
the questions if you like because I don't
think anyone thinks that I’ve planted my

216
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:33,390
immediate family in this hole, but, Carol,
stay out of it. Bring it on.

217
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:42,870
&gt;&gt; 
Thank you for coming to Google.

218
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:48,309
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: It’s my honor.
&gt;&gt; So you make it sound really, really simple.

219
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:52,890
I mean you have explanations for everything.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yeah.

220
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:58,980
&gt;&gt; And I agree with a lot of your arguments
and, you know, I lived in, like, a socialist

221
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:04,559
country. I mean, I come from Croatia so I,
you know, I empathize with a little bit of

222
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:10,060
when you say like the axis of evil and especially
North Korea being a perfect theocracy, I can

223
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:16,330
relate to that. But I don't understand why
do you say that these people really want to

224
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:22,340
be enslaved, if you could explain this to
me. I mean, I think there’s really a system,

225
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:29,850
you know, like set up by a minority which
is really a brutal system and I don't understand

226
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,880
about the part, like, you know, like this
is something that these people want so...

227
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,030
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Did you say you were Croatian?
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

228
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:43,309
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yeah. Well, then you--then I
would be upset if you thought I meant that

229
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:47,711
these man-made regimes were there because
people wanted them to be, no. That’s not

230
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:50,950
what I meant at all about North Korea. Particularly,
these have been riveted onto...

231
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:56,139
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: ...people. I mean, North Korea

232
00:21:56,139 --> 00:22:02,000
is a hermetic place unfortunately in that
it has ocean on either side of it; the Demilitarized

233
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,299
Zone which is several miles wide on the south
and Russia and China on the north. So, you

234
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:11,630
have a place where you can horribly conduct
an experiment on human beings, essentially.

235
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,960
You can isolate them totally. The North Korean
State was set up in the same year that Orwell

236
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:22,880
published 1984. And you almost think that
somebody gave Kim Il-sung a copy of 1984 in

237
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,320
Korean and said, “Do you think we could
make this fly?” And he said, “Well, I

238
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,870
can’t be sure. We sure can give it the old
college try.” Because that’s how it feels

239
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:36,000
there. I went there, I thought, I've had his
experience--I’ll just digress for a second.

240
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,139
I’ve had this experience twice in my life.
Journalists hate cliché. I know it doesn’t

241
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:44,280
always seem like that when you read the papers,
but we try and avoid them. I went to Prague

242
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,950
once under the old days of the communist regime.
I thought whatever happens to me here, I’m

243
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,919
not going to mention Franz Kafka in my essay.
I’m going to be the first journalist not

244
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,429
to do it. I went to a meeting of the opposition
underground, somebody betrayed us because

245
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:03,460
the secret police came in and, suddenly, wham
like just broke down the door, dogs, torches,

246
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,830
rubber truncheons. They slammed me against
the wall, you’re under arrest. Well, I demand

247
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,919
to see the British ambassador. Blah, blah,
you’re under arrest. What’s the charge?

248
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,340
We don't have to tell you that. I thought,
fuck, I’ve got to mention Kafka after all.

249
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:24,080
They make you do it. Well, I--that’s actually
what a cliché is. That’s--communism is

250
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,750
a cliché in itself. The same in North Korea;
I thought I don’t want to mention Orwell;

251
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,950
I don't want to mention Orwell; have not have
to mention. There’s no--there’s no other

252
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:37,840
stand of comparison. No, what I meant about
the fear of freedom was this: Many, many people

253
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:45,899
don't of course want to live under a hellish
starvation regime of gulag type, like that.

254
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:50,639
But they, they quite like being told what
to do. They don't want to be told that life

255
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:53,780
doesn’t--the world doesn’t owe them a
living and that they’re on their own and

256
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,370
they--they quite like it and repeatedly vote
for parties and, sometimes, leaders who promise

257
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,880
to provide everything as long as they'll give
up just a little bit of freedom, just a little

258
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,669
bit. In the tradeoff, you’ll get more security
and more welfare. It’s a temptation. In

259
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:15,090
some cases, it takes an extreme form, and
I'm very impressed by how often when I debate

260
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:19,450
with the religious people, they will tell
me that they’ve--they gravitate towards

261
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:26,460
faith because they want someone to, if you
like, to look after them. The whole idea of

262
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:36,170
a heavenly father, for example, is built up
on this. The--the old joke says some say God

263
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:43,620
is dead, some say God is dad, you figure.
Then there are people who--well, Islam for

264
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:49,509
example, the word means, the word Islam means
surrender, prostration. You give everything

265
00:24:49,509 --> 00:24:55,720
to God. Everything is in his hands. This is
implicit in the Qur'an. That’s what I mean.

266
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,690
But I think what’s innate in most people
is the feeling that they quite like someone

267
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,779
to take care of them all of the time so it
can be hard to argue with them that there

268
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:07,980
is no such person.
&gt;&gt; I understand better now but...

269
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,250
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Okay.
&gt;&gt; You see, I--just to follow up a little

270
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:19,090
bit. So is there a possibility there to say
that then some people are more freedom-loving

271
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:24,289
than others and is this some sort of, you
know, like--I wouldn’t call it racism but,

272
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:29,269
you know, like, differentiating people by
their love towards freedom and all that?

273
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:34,960
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: No, I’m certain that the same
feelings are innate in all people. And one

274
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,169
day, there will be a North Korean edition
of 1984, and it will be a huge bestseller

275
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:40,169
there.
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

276
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:44,110
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: I am as sure of that as I can
be of anything. Though, at the moment, it’s

277
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:49,610
hard to imagine there’s anyone in North
Korea who's even allowed to consider the concept

278
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:54,499
of political liberty. It will come because
it is innate. I have no doubt about that.

279
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:58,250
&gt;&gt; To follow up to on this fear of freedom
and this is an innate idea, sorry to beat

280
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,240
that horse, but what do you--what do you think
would possibly replace this? I also think

281
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,700
that there are some--I mean it’s obviously
much easier to say my life is out of my control

282
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,149
and these events are out of my control so,
you know, I’m going to thank God for the

283
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:14,740
good things and, you know, hate the devil
for the bad things, whatever. So, like, you

284
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:20,159
know, from Plato to Nietsche to Socrates--or
Descartes have said it’s difficult to choose

285
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,169
the life where you're actually deciding and
making choices for yourself and taking responsibility

286
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:29,510
and appreciating the fact that the world doesn’t
care about your existence and then doing what

287
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,340
you need to do with that, and it is difficult.
How do we, you know, well--how could we possibly

288
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,450
imagine a world where everybody buys into
that idea and how do we--where would we go

289
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,840
like, where would that structure that some
people feel they can’t do without, where

290
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,509
would they get that from? I guess what would--what
would religion be replaced by so to fulfill

291
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:49,830
this natural need?
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yeah. Well, I would say that

292
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:56,500
emancipating ourselves from religion and from
the combined sort of solipsism and masochism,

293
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:03,190
this is what I was trying to say to the comrade
here a moment ago. Religion says to you, remember,

294
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:08,460
the monotheistic ones, you're a miserable
sinner, your sin is original, you can't escape

295
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,930
it, you’re born as a wretch, you’re made
out of dust or according to the Qur'an, a

296
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:19,710
clot of blood, you’re a worm, you’re nothing,
you know, but a piece of gunk basically. But--and

297
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:25,309
you got to work really hard to get away from
the terrible punishment that awaits you for

298
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:32,440
that. So total abnegation, but there’s also
good news. The universe is designed with you

299
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:38,350
in mind, and God has a plan for you personally.
So just when the person thinks they can't

300
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:42,340
take anymore abuse--it’s like being inducted
into a cult. Just where the person thinks

301
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:47,200
they can't take anymore humiliation, they're
told, oh, but father loves you and he wants

302
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,659
you to join our group. That’s not good for
people. You’d be better off without it.

303
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:55,620
So would everyone you know, so it’s not
a matter of what we would put in its place,

304
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:00,400
we wouldn’t. We’d be emancipated from
that kind of sadomasochism. That’s a good

305
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:07,669
thing to start off with. Second, we have the
wonders and beauty of science to study. We

306
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:12,760
have instead of ancient texts that are full
of lies and myths, we have increasingly a

307
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:19,879
wonderful world literature that’s available
to anybody who can read even a little--most

308
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:23,570
recently, I would cite you, because yesterday
was the birthday of India, happy birthday

309
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:28,080
by the way to all Indians here. And Pakistanis,
though if you insist, I think the partition

310
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:35,159
was a huge mistake. There’s a--and religious
partition is the worst kind, and it’s going

311
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,779
to lead one day to a thermonuclear war so--I
didn’t have time to go into that but maybe

312
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:45,759
someone will ask me. There's incredible literature
in English written by Indians. It’s sort

313
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:52,200
of a sub-branch--but I shouldn’t even say
sub; I mean a branch--a new branch of English

314
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,370
writing by Indians in English. It's becoming
a great part of world literature. There’s

315
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:00,850
all this extraordinary excitement. And people
say no, no, no, you should--as Thomas Aquinas

316
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,320
said, a man of one book, you know, you should
be reading a bible, you don't really need

317
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,549
anything else, they’re destroying libraries
in the Muslim world that could have any books

318
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:17,269
that contradict the Qur'an, this is no way
to live. But having said all that, and said

319
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:22,289
what the--and the consolations of philosophy
too which aren’t that hard to study are

320
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:27,490
very rewarding. And ethical and moral dilemmas
that you get out of the study of literature,

321
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:34,799
George Eliot, Dostoyevsky, people of that
kind, James Joyce. Still, it’s only a necessary

322
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,860
condition, not a sufficient one. There are
no guarantees and an atheist can be a nihilist,

323
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:44,220
or a sadist, or a Stalinist, or a fascist,
it’d be unlikely the last one but that’s

324
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:50,679
possible. Okay. But we--there are no guarantees
and in part that it’s the recognition of

325
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:58,210
that, that’s the beginning of wisdom as
well as I think the beginning of liberty.

326
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,789
&gt;&gt; One short and one longer one, I just want
to be sure, I assume that you have read the

327
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:06,960
"Captain Stormfield's Journey To Heaven" by
Mark Twain.

328
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,709
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Sorry. Yes, I've read a lot of
Mr. Clemens on religion.

329
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:18,159
&gt;&gt; Yes. That seemed a sort of a definitive
work on the hierarchy structure of a more

330
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,820
standard religion.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yes. By the way, you can't read

331
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,659
too much Twain, ladies and gentlemen, on the
subject. But now all of his stuff is available.

332
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:29,149
There are websites on Mark Twain and religion.
It used to be really hard to get his writings

333
00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:34,950
on religion even 10 years ago. Sorry.
&gt;&gt; And my longer question which hopefully

334
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:40,429
won't choke you up. Actually, I have several
friends who are very well-educated, in some

335
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:47,110
cases in the sciences, who became religious
late in life. They have been atheist or agnostic,

336
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:52,190
and then just decided they were feeling something
and became religious. Do you have anything

337
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,840
to say on that sort of grounds or why that
might be occurring?

338
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:01,829
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yes. I suppose I could speculate,
but that’s all I would be doing.

339
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:07,070
&gt;&gt; Of course.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: I think for some people, the

340
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:12,669
Hubble View, say, does have the opposite effect
from the one it has on me. It makes people

341
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:21,029
feel, well, then, whoever designed this must
be even more amazing than I thought. And that’s--there

342
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:27,590
are attempts made by creationists now to say
that. Instead of saying, "No, Darwin was wrong.

343
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:33,110
God made all this stuff." They now say, "Well,
okay, there was evolution, but God did that,

344
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:40,270
too." So as you may know arguments that explain
everything, explain nothing. That’s a definite

345
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:48,399
principle I think of underlying full cognition.
If they can bend their argument so it can

346
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:53,039
comprehend everything, comprise everything
then it isn't an argument. But I think that

347
00:31:53,039 --> 00:32:00,410
we are certainly made in such a way to be
worshipfully inclined, shall we say. That

348
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:05,879
tendency is certainly within us. And when
people think that there's something awe inspiring,

349
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:12,029
what they feel is awe. And then what they
feel is well, maybe there's some majesty I

350
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:17,639
should be acknowledging here, though that
isn't at all a logical step. By the way, do

351
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:21,000
you know about "awe?"
&gt;&gt; In what sense?

352
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,509
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: John Wayne played the Roman centurion
in one of the films about the crucifixion?

353
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:28,660
&gt;&gt; I don’t...
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: And there's a certain point the

354
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:32,090
rain has to come down hard, and there's thunder
and lightning and the veil of the temple splits

355
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:37,470
and so on. And John Wayne standing as a centurion
is supposed to say, "Truly, this was the son

356
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:43,230
of God." So he does this. I forget who the
director was--I think it’s Houston. And

357
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:50,481
cue rain, thunder and lightning, so Wayne
stands there stoically, and utters, "Truly,

358
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:55,389
this was the son of God." And the director's,
"John, that was great. That was terrific.

359
00:32:55,389 --> 00:33:03,279
I just wonder if we could have it with a little
more awe." So they cued again the rain, thunder,

360
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,941
the veil of the temple splits into Wayne,
earthquakes, you know. It's all happening

361
00:33:07,941 --> 00:33:17,269
and Wayne says, "Aw, truly, this was the son
of God."

362
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:21,429
&gt;&gt; So this is a kind of a follow-up on Tom's
question. I have a buddy who styles himself

363
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:26,909
as a kind of an allegorical pagan. And he's
had a lot of angry criticisms of religion,

364
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:31,620
many of which echo yours. But at the same
time he feels in himself a kind of a biological

365
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:36,610
need to be part of a circle of believers in
a community which he feels helps his rather

366
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:40,210
fragile emotional demeanor. He goes through,
you know, depression and things like that,

367
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:45,000
and he finds that belief. So what he'd done
is try to find what he feels as the least

368
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,539
obnoxious religion he could find and then
not take it too seriously. What would you

369
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:55,460
say to such a person?
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Well, that used to be called

370
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:04,139
the Church of England--or, the Unitarians,
about whom Bertrand Russell said, "The great

371
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:11,000
thing about them is they believe in one god
maximum." Peter DeVries is very good on this.

372
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,370
He says people used to be a pagan and polytheist
and believe in multiple gods, and then they

373
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:20,640
started believing in one god and they're going
nearer the true figure all the time. This

374
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:28,639
is progress.
&gt;&gt; On an article, I believe it was that I

375
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,540
read, you seemed reluctant to endorse if not
critical of Richard Dawkins's attempt to sort

376
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,429
of organize the atheists under the title of
Brights.

377
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:41,169
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yes.
&gt;&gt; And I believe that your comment was that

378
00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:48,250
we infidels need no such machinery of reinforcement.
My question is, if like-minded people do not

379
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:55,560
organize, especially if those whose ideals
we oppose are more organized, how can we attempt

380
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,670
to--kind of steer our society the way that
we would like it to go?

381
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,720
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Well, I was to have said this
to the previous question. I mean, I’m in

382
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:10,950
some ways the wrong person to ask these questions.
I’m no longer a joiner up of groups. I don’t

383
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:16,039
feel the belonging need anymore. I used to
when I was younger and more left than I am

384
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:20,451
now feel that the need to be involved in an
organized way. Now I don’t, and I think

385
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:25,140
I probably have more influence as an individual
than I ever did as a cogwheel in a so-called

386
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:30,940
party. A point for anyone to ponder actually
who was asked have they ever considered registering

387
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,260
independent, for example. People may fight
harder for your vote if you don’t give it

388
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:41,791
away in advance. Separate question, and it’s
very important to me that I don’t belong

389
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:46,470
to a church. People who believe as I believe
don’t need to get together all the time

390
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:53,650
and remind ourselves what we believe, reinforce
it, ram it home in case we forget the incredible

391
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:58,040
propositions that, you know, we're singing
and all those kind of things. You just recognize

392
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,599
a fellow free-thinker when you meet one. That
should be enough. And in any country or any

393
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:12,950
language as well. There will be in Washington
in October the big gathering where Richard

394
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:18,500
Dawkins and Daniel Dennett and Sam Harris,
[INDISTINCT] and myself and many others are

395
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:23,569
going to be--Victor Stinger. Because there
has been an extraordinary vogue of successful

396
00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:27,880
books on this subject now, and I think there's
a change in the Zeitgeist going on about religion.

397
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,410
And let me just say this, if that Zeitgeist
has been brought about, the change has been

398
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:39,140
brought about in that Zeitgeist, it hasn’t
been by any organization. It's by a group

399
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:45,849
of like-minded people writing their hearts
out and refusing to be intimidated by religious

400
00:36:45,849 --> 00:36:50,770
bullying. Or, to allow religious nonsense
to be taught in the schools, for example,

401
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:57,900
in place of science. Or to allow euphemisms
to be spread about the behavior of the parties

402
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:03,290
of god in Iraq or elsewhere. That’s what
created it, not an organization but what you

403
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:08,880
might call an intellectual tendency. I think
that’s fine. I think it's encouraging.

404
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,330
&gt;&gt; Hi. A few of the things that you said don’t
really seem consistent with our experience

405
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:17,059
in the United States. Two things in particular:
one is that you said, you know, once people,

406
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:20,770
you know, have Hubble telescopes and microscopes,
the burning bush is not as interesting. And

407
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:24,609
the other thing you said is that, you know,
religion kind of fits into, you know, innate

408
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:28,800
human nature for, you know, being told what
to do or not having as much freedom. Well,

409
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,980
in the United States, we have the most advanced,
wealthy, most powerful nation in probably

410
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:37,680
the history of the world, and you have probably
the most freedom-loving, you know, almost

411
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,530
inventive--not inventing but really espousing
the philosophy of freedom and individuality

412
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:46,890
and trying to, you know, propagate that throughout
the world. Yet, you also have the most religious

413
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:51,400
nation. Well, it's true. I mean, you can argue
with the methods but I mean, there's no question

414
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,470
that like we are trying to promote democracy.
And yet you have, yeah, the most religious

415
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:02,200
nation. You have like people going to church
is probably an all-time high. Religious people

416
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,339
affect who are leaders are, you know, to a
great degree. So how do you explain like that

417
00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:08,270
contradiction?
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Well, I don’t think it’s

418
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:12,970
a contradiction because religious, the section
of the constitution means you can have religious

419
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:19,790
pluralism. Now for example where I come from,
originally, you can tell I was born in England.

420
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:24,380
The head of the church is the head of the
state and the head of the armed forces. It's

421
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:30,900
an official church and you have to pay for
it and whether you want to or not. And on

422
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:37,920
the moment that her majesty, the Queen, expires,
the head of the Church of England will become

423
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:47,329
a bat-eared half-Muslim with no taste in,
for women as far as I can see, the lugubrious

424
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:57,109
Prince Charles, who goes to classes on Islam
and talks to plants and is a loon. That’s

425
00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:02,560
what you get for founding a church on the
family values of Henry VIII. In the United

426
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,400
States, you can't have any of that. That would
be unconstitutional. You can belong to any

427
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:11,820
church you want, the government has nothing
to do with that. And people I think take a

428
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:17,400
Toquevillian view, if you like, of the church.
They go, many of them, to church for social

429
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,920
reasons. Some of them for ethnic ones, some
of them for charitable, some of them for community

430
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,069
reasons as you might say. If you ask someone
now--I've been doing this a lot recently.

431
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:32,770
I have debated at every stop of my book tour.
Okay, so said you are a Baptist minister,

432
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:37,550
yes. Well, do you believe in John Calvin's
teaching on predestination and hell fire?

433
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:43,510
Why do you want to know? Well, because you
said you were a Baptist. Yeah, but I mean

434
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:47,010
I’m a Southern Baptist, you know that kind.
Well, come one. They don’t love the question.

435
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:53,410
They--or ask the Catholics if they really
believe what their church teaches or what

436
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:58,569
the Pope tells them. Of course they don’t
for the most part. The fastest growing group

437
00:39:58,569 --> 00:40:02,670
of people in the country has been measured
as being those of who have no belief or who

438
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:08,121
are atheists. By far the fastest growing,
it’s doubled in the last ten years. People

439
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:11,200
are evidently lying to the opinion polls,
that there are not enough churches in the

440
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,460
country; there are plenty of them. They’re
not enough to take all the people who say

441
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,881
that they go to them, just couldn’t be done,
couldn’t fit them in. I don’t think that

442
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:22,410
people who have doubts about religion are
going to tell them to opinion pollsters who

443
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:26,890
call them up at dinner time. They will say,
yes, I am a Methodist or whatever it is, they’re

444
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:34,160
not going say I sometimes wonder if John Wesley
was really the man. Not when the multiple

445
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,611
choice boxes are being gone through. So, but
unfortunately, I mean, there are people who

446
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:47,180
think that that’s the way to go politically.
The president for example thinks that to say

447
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:53,180
someone is person of faith is axiomatically
to confer a compliment on them. And if you

448
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:59,190
remember, he did it to Vladimir Putin, KGB
goon and hood, and increasingly evidently

449
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:03,240
a very dangerous man to have in charge in
Russia. President meets and says right away,

450
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,110
“Right away, well, I could tell by looking
into his eyes and seeing he was wearing his

451
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:12,160
grandmother’s crucifix, that he was just
the chap for me.” Now, in a strong field,

452
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:20,770
I think that’s the stupidest thing the president
has yet said. And he must, I think, occasionally

453
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:25,730
regret it. And I got, tried to get a research
to this one to find out just, I just need

454
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:30,900
to know something, has Vladimir Putin ever
worn his grandmother’s crucifix since? Had

455
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:36,200
he ever been seen wearing it before? Or did
he just think this should be enough for the

456
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:46,290
president of the United States? Because if
so, it would show that religion was not just

457
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:50,690
metaphysically incorrect, but as I have I
believe said, a danger and a poison to all

458
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:56,020
of us. If our republic can be—and its president
can be pushed over, like that, like someone

459
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,780
offering garlic to a vampire, then we really
are in trouble.

460
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:03,970
&gt;&gt; Just a follow-up, though, it just sounds
like you would have almost no religion in

461
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:08,059
the U.S. if you—if it’s true that you
were saying, that once you became an advanced

462
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:11,491
scientific society, you know, you’d lose
interest in religion which is not the case.

463
00:42:11,491 --> 00:42:16,569
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: All right. I’d say a bit more,
I mean, take the case of the so-called “intelligent

464
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:20,579
design school” they want at least equal
time, they used to want to ban evolution,

465
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:25,569
now they want equal time in schools. So, they
brought with their Discovery Institute friends

466
00:42:25,569 --> 00:42:38,930
from Washington, moves on school boards and
courts in Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas and the

467
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:45,940
most conservative County of Pennsylvania around
the town of Dover. And they have been humiliated

468
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:51,410
in each case. And this is in Kansas, in Texas,
in Oklahoma and in the most reactionary part

469
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:55,950
of Pennsylvania. Thrown off the school board
by the electorate and thrown out of court

470
00:42:55,950 --> 00:43:02,160
as flat out unconstitutional by the judges,
in all cases, Reagan Republican appointees.

471
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,190
And I don’t know what they’re going to
do next, these rednecks, I don’t know what

472
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:10,150
they’re going to do. But, I know why it
doesn’t work, and why it’s not going to

473
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:15,240
work, because there may be many parents in
Kansas who say, “Well, I personally think

474
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,990
that God made the rocks and so on and only
made them 6,000 years ago.” But they don’t

475
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:23,750
want their children taught that in school.
They don’t want to come from a state where

476
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:28,079
they get laughed at when they say where they’re
from. Oh you’re from Kansas, that’s the

477
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,140
place where… they don’t like that. It’s
the same, it was the same with the confederate

478
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,761
flag issue, quite apart from the racism. A
lot of people who didn’t want to come from

479
00:43:35,761 --> 00:43:39,780
a state that had a confederate battle flag
on its [INDISTINCT]. Among other things people

480
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,180
won’t have their conventions in your state
and you’ll suffer for that too. You’ll

481
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:47,200
get laughed at when you travel, they don’t
want this. And nor should they have to put

482
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,849
up with it because of a handful of crackpots.
So, no, I don’t say there aren’t a lot

483
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:56,450
of devout people in this country and I don’t
say that science just negates religion. But

484
00:43:56,450 --> 00:44:02,760
I say that the influence of religion as opposed
to scientific rationalism is hugely overestimated,

485
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:09,099
yeah. Shouldn’t—shouldn’t impress people
to the point where they feel it must - can’t

486
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:17,510
be opposed.
&gt;&gt; Thank you for coming. I think you already

487
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:24,579
answered one of my questions regarding organizing
a larger effort. So separate from that I want

488
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:29,970
to get just some comments and thoughts based
upon idea of if there is going to be an independent

489
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:36,520
movement whether at the Atheist or Anti-theist
movement whether you’re part of it or not,

490
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:42,400
if you have any suggestions for the average
person not may not have say a publishing company

491
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,670
or a production company, but does have the
Internet, you know, does have their own thoughts...

492
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,420
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Right.
&gt;&gt; And keyboard in front of them, what they

493
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:54,210
can do to either give resources to other people
or to actually express their thoughts in ways

494
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:58,100
that you find to actually be, you know, exceptional.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yes.

495
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,329
&gt;&gt; Furter some sort of movement, if there
may be one.

496
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:06,160
&gt;. HITCHEN: Yeah, my friend, Rich Dawkins
actually at the end of his book, The God Delusion,

497
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:12,369
does have a list which you can look up, and
his is an excellent book, I should say, of

498
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:18,100
websites where so to say, help is available.
Well, there’s one for example, there is

499
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:22,280
a very important one of called, “Leaving
Islam,” is about people want to get out

500
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:27,010
and are afraid or are being intimidated, ways
of actually doing it and finding contact with

501
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:31,121
people who feel the same way. Very serious
because there are quite a lot of our fellow

502
00:45:31,121 --> 00:45:34,329
citizens now who don’t feel that they do
have religious freedom because they are imprisoned

503
00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:38,619
in a religion that can kill them for even
considering changing their minds about it,

504
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:43,640
this is no small matter. But I tell you what
I would do, I would become a subscriber to

505
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:49,290
a magazine called Free Inquiry which is published
out of Amherst, New York, it’s every month

506
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:55,720
I think, a very, very good rationalist and
skeptical magazine which has itself a lot

507
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:01,520
of local activities that you can look up.
And then, there’s another magazine called

508
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,730
Skeptical Inquiry, published from nearer here,
maybe more appeal to people of a scientific

509
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:11,380
or technical bent which does things likes
they expose frauds that are on TV claiming

510
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:19,640
to be able to put you in touch with your relatives,
or divine water or all these kinds of nutbags

511
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:25,260
that are often featured on primetime shows.
And puts you also in touch with the work the

512
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:35,569
great magicians, Penn and Teller and James
Randy, who again show that miracles are easy.

513
00:46:35,569 --> 00:46:40,589
And they can also show the fraudulence of
anyone who tries to exploit them, a world

514
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:46,380
of wonder awaits you. And these magazines
will also show you and point out to the areas

515
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:52,799
where resistance is needed, say to the continued
attempt to teach nonsense in American schools,

516
00:46:52,799 --> 00:46:58,140
“Yes, children that concludes the biology
period, and now get ready for your creation

517
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:04,839
studies hour and after the astronomy class
we will have the astrology class for equal

518
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:11,240
time, and then the chemistry alchemy period.”
It’s enough to make a cat laugh, isn’t

519
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:15,940
it? There are people think this is what should
be done to stultify American children. So,

520
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:22,199
you can meet up with other people could think
that that’s a bad idea.

521
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:27,430
&gt;&gt; Yeah, two things, an observation and a
concern, my first observation is that I think

522
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:31,299
you share something in common with Jesus in
that both of you have seems to be attacking

523
00:47:31,299 --> 00:47:36,599
aspects of religion, but often in his case,
he attacked specific religious leaders whereas

524
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:46,210
you attack religion itself. And, I was…
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: No, our resemblances are often

525
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:49,650
pointed out.
&gt;&gt; I’m sad to hear, I thought for sure I’d

526
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:57,340
be the first. And secondly, the bit of concern,
if we start going more and more toward Atheism,

527
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:01,200
you mentioned some of the horrible things
that happened in the name of religion, but

528
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:07,599
I look at one of the greatest genocides or
at least mass murders ever, was by the Soviet

529
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:14,560
Union under Lenin and Stalin when in the name
of among another things Atheism, they killed

530
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:21,309
an enormously large number of their own people.
And what do you think would prevent that from

531
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:26,270
happening if indeed you were successful?
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: I have a chapter on this in my

532
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:29,079
book because it is a very frequently asked
question, I think it’s also a very serious

533
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:36,200
one, I have to condense the chapter if I may,
but here’s the situation. Until 1917, the

534
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:41,450
year of the Russian Revolution, millions of
Russians, millions and millions of them had

535
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:46,369
for hundreds and hundreds of years been told
that the head of the state, the Czar, was

536
00:48:46,369 --> 00:48:51,099
also the head of the church and was a little
more than human, he was the little father

537
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:55,109
of the people. He wasn’t quite divine. He
was more like a saint than human. And he owned

538
00:48:55,109 --> 00:49:00,670
everything in the country and everything was
due to him. That’s how a gigantic layer

539
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:09,460
Russian society was inculcated with servile,
fatalistic ideas. If you are Josef Stalin,

540
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:14,059
you shouldn’t be in the dictatorship business
in the first place if you can’t realize

541
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:18,789
this is a huge opportunity for you, you’ve
inherited a population that’s servile and

542
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:25,740
credulous and superstitious. Well, what does
Stalin do? He sets up an inquisition. He has

543
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:31,619
heresy hunts, trials of heretics, the Moscow
trials. He proclaims miracles, Lysenko’s

544
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:36,770
agriculture that was supposed to produce three
harvests a year or whatever it was, the pseudo-biology

545
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:42,150
that would feed everyone in a week. He says
all thanks are due at all times to the leader

546
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:45,819
and you must praise him at all times for his
goodness and kindness. And incidentally, he

547
00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:51,000
always kept the Russian Orthodox Church on
his side, it split. It split the church and

548
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,420
some of them moved to New York and set up
a rival. But the Russian Orthodox Church remained

549
00:49:55,420 --> 00:50:01,030
part of the regime, he was not so stupid as
not to know he had to do that, just as Hitler

550
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:06,790
and Mussolini made an even more aggressive
deal with the Roman Catholic Church and with

551
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:11,160
some of the Protestants. And remember the
other great axis of evil person of that time,

552
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:18,450
the Emperor of Japan, was not just a religious
person but actually a god. So Fascism, Communism

553
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:24,329
and Stalinism and Nazism are nothing like
as secular as some people think, and much

554
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:30,650
more religious than most people know. But
here's what a fair test would be: find a society

555
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:40,020
that's adopted the teachings of Spinoza, Voltaire,
Galileo, Einstein, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson

556
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:46,190
and gone down the pits as result of doing
that into famine and war and dictatorship

557
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:51,333
and torture and repression. That would be
a fair test. That's the test I'd like to--that's

558
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:57,390
the experiment I'd like to run. I don’t
think that's going to end up with a gulag.

559
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:02,869
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you for coming.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Thank you for having me.

560
00:51:02,869 --> 00:51:08,430
&gt;&gt; More ladies asking questions would be awesome
and please, I implore you to be really hilarious

561
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:10,980
so we can prove Mr. Hitchens is wrong about
why women cannot be funny.

562
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:18,730
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: I was wondering what you would--what
you've done with your chicks here I must say.

563
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:25,069
&gt;&gt; We are a technology company. So, I'm not
religious but just to play a little devil's

564
00:51:25,069 --> 00:51:30,680
advocate, what do you say to studies that
show that people who consistently go to church,

565
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:35,140
who pray, who believe in God have, like, lower
blood pressure and live longer lives, et cetera?

566
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:41,559
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Well, I’d say it wouldn't--wouldn't
prove much. I mean, the--if it hard to prove--I'm

567
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:48,280
not sure I would be able to trust the methodology
but suppose it was true, the same could be

568
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:59,000
said of being a Moonie for example. I mean,
it's said--it is said that Louis Farrakhan's

569
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:06,251
racist crackpot Nation of Islam and its sectarian
gang gets young men of drugs, for all I know

570
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:11,930
it does, it may but that doesn’t recommend
it to me. Nor does it prove a thing about

571
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:17,660
its theology, if you see what I mean. Whereas
I can absolutely tell you that of the suicide

572
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:26,640
bombing population 100% are faith based. And
I don’t think that that in itself disproves

573
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:32,510
faith but I think it should make you skeptical
of that kind of random sampling.

574
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:36,330
&gt;&gt; Sure. There seemed to be...
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Of the genital mutilation community

575
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:40,569
the same can be said.
&gt;&gt; I've a lot of progressive religious friends

576
00:52:40,569 --> 00:52:43,750
who--I used to be pretty condescending towards
religion but I feel like I've learned a lot

577
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:47,609
from them and learned about their religious
practice and what it means to them and as

578
00:52:47,609 --> 00:52:50,670
you stated earlier a lot of religious people
don’t really believe all the tenets of what

579
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:56,390
their faith says anyway. So, I feel like those
friends of mine are looking for community

580
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:02,620
and looking for a feeling of oneness with
other people and with the universe and ultimately

581
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:07,170
on a scientific level that bears out anyway
because on like a quantum level everything

582
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:12,690
is one and is the same. So, I feel like churches
at least in this country provide the sense

583
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:18,059
of community that I don’t think exists any
other way in our culture. I don’t feel like

584
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:22,160
I had that growing up and I feel like my friends
that went to churchm they can go back to their

585
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:27,210
church now and there are all of these adults
that aside from their parents that were there

586
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:30,420
to nurture them as they were growing up and
then ask how they're doing and I never had

587
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:34,040
that. So, I'm jealous of that in a sense.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: It takes a lot to make me cry

588
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:44,569
but you...See me afterwards, I mean, the way
it just--look actually it’s what I said

589
00:53:44,569 --> 00:53:49,430
about if there's any who read, who read de
Toqueville, in Democracy in America should--that's

590
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:54,760
what he said about--about communitarianism
and religion. It's very--it's the reason why

591
00:53:54,760 --> 00:54:00,740
America is so religious but it's a different
form of religion. Ask yourself a related question,

592
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:05,640
it's amazing to me how many Americans change
religion when they get married. You hear it

593
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:09,900
all the time, you've heard it. I used to be
Seventh Day Adventist but my wife was Congregationalist,

594
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,751
now I go to the Congregationalists. It doesn’t
matter the Seventh Day Adventist used to say,

595
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:18,799
if you don’t stay with us you're going straight
to hell. Change very easily. Go to another

596
00:54:18,799 --> 00:54:24,680
church instead. Wouldn't consider perhaps
not going to one but it shows the--the depth

597
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:32,630
of the strength of religious allegiance. I
also think that, well, it's notorious about,

598
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:39,700
say, Polish Catholics in Chicago or Greek
Orthodox or many Jews, the church has been

599
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:46,440
a means of transmitting and preserving an
ethnic tradition as well. The solidarity in

600
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:51,310
the face of often quiet bleak kinds of life,
and now there's even a phenomenon known as

601
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:58,559
Churchianity. It’s expressed by the megachurches,
the people who live half transient lives don’t

602
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,619
have very stable employment or residence who
are often moving around the country. On a

603
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:07,450
Sunday they want to know where they can go
take the old jalopy and be among friends,

604
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:13,400
and these characters are waiting for them
believe you me to remove what few savings

605
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:20,369
they do have left from them. Because that's
another indissoluble fact about American religion

606
00:55:20,369 --> 00:55:24,741
just as community and blood pressure may be
involved. It has to be mentioned in the same

607
00:55:24,741 --> 00:55:31,859
breath as open fraud to an absolutely astonishing
extent. I mean, the shake down community,

608
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:39,210
the genital mutilation community, the suicide
bombing community, the child abuse I would

609
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:44,299
prefer to say child rape communities, all
these are communities of faith, believe you

610
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:49,299
me.
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's my turn?

611
00:55:49,299 --> 00:55:53,540
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: What's up?
&gt;&gt; Try to diverge a little from the immediate

612
00:55:53,540 --> 00:56:02,430
subjects. You expressed your regrets for this
perverse impulse in the human spirit which

613
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:09,289
seems to desire to be dominated, to prostrate
itself before the mysterious altar of power.

614
00:56:09,289 --> 00:56:14,289
It occurs to me that the current government
of this nation has in a calculated fashion,

615
00:56:14,289 --> 00:56:19,779
exploited this perverse desire and exploited
the language which seems to inspire it or

616
00:56:19,779 --> 00:56:25,960
appeal to it. Now, I'm strongly opposed to
a particular policy of this government which

617
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:34,420
is the indefinite detention of so-called terrorist
suspects in Cuba and in particular I dislike

618
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:39,970
the way the government tries to justify this
policy by using these very discourses of power

619
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:47,610
and secrecy which come of a particular religious
stamp. So I would like to ask and--not to

620
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:52,180
be impertinent how you can square what you've
said today with other comments you've made

621
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:57,760
apparently in support of this very policy.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: There's no danger of you being

622
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:04,700
impertinent so don’t worry about that. I've
just returned from Guantanamo, when I say

623
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,630
just I was there last month. It took me a
long time to get down and haven't yet written

624
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:14,160
anything about it so you won't know my views
as I'm not sure that I know them in full myself,

625
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:20,569
but about your question, I know what my views
are about indefinite detention in principle.

626
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:29,920
I didn't see or must have missed any allusion
that all made to religion, in the decision

627
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:37,380
to declare them enemy combatants. You're suggesting
there was a religious justification for the

628
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:41,680
detention policy?
&gt;&gt; Not a religious justification per se but

629
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:48,210
in my opinion the Bush administration in its
public deliveries often uses a language of

630
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:54,579
power very much akin to that used by religious
tyrants and demagogues down the centuries

631
00:57:54,579 --> 00:57:59,390
and this language comes up particularly strongly
when justifying controversial actions such

632
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:02,119
as Guantanamo Bay.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Well, again I think we have a

633
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:06,540
disagreement, I mean the language they seem
to use to me is the language of the secular

634
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:11,859
language of emergency powers and special circumstances
requiring extraordinary measures and that’s

635
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:16,849
a very old argument especially in the United
States, it goes back to President Lincoln’s

636
00:58:16,849 --> 00:58:21,839
attempt to suspend habeas corpus in the Civil
War. It reminds me of that and not of any

637
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:27,550
argument about or with theocracy.
&gt;&gt; Emergency powers and extraordinary rendition

638
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:40,430
and other times like this to me rather smack
of secrecy jargon at the same time used by

639
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:45,490
preachers.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Or by secular despots. I just

640
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:49,380
don’t think you’re quite carrying your
point about the theological. If by all means

641
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:55,240
if you want to discuss the question of civil
liberties, let’s do so, but it’s a departure

642
00:58:55,240 --> 00:59:01,619
from the rubric. The Bush administration is
not conducting a holy war in this respect.

643
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:07,140
It is confronting a holy war, however. One
thing you can’t miss about the inhabitants

644
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:13,050
of Guantanamo is how faith based they are,
and that’s part of the reason why we are

645
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:18,170
presented with this problem. The difference
seems to me to be the following, if you treat

646
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:23,990
them as criminals, as some argue, then you
can’t say really that you are fighting a

647
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:28,190
war, then it’s only a law and order question.
If you say you’re fighting a war, then in

648
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:32,559
what sense are these not enemy soldiers? If
they are enemy soldiers, how can you try them

649
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:37,380
as criminals? Why are you holding people as
criminals and building a military tribunal,

650
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:42,050
I visited the room where they’re going to
have them tried, where they will be able to

651
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:46,240
say, “Well, thanks for having me here and
admitting that I am a soldier, when the whole

652
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:51,320
point is that the Geneva Convention says that
they’re not. So that’s bad enough to begin

653
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:57,020
with and it’s a territory no government
has yet had to step onto. But in addition,

654
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:01,930
we’re apparently not allowed to do any of
those things, nor are we allowed extraordinary

655
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:05,500
rendition nor can we have return them to their
countries of origin in case they get maltreated

656
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:10,119
there by their own governments. Well, this
leaves the—apparently only two alternatives.

657
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:17,109
One is not to take any prisoners. And the
other is to let everybody go and say we’ve

658
01:00:17,109 --> 01:00:21,770
got no right to hold you. And neither of these
seems to be very attractive. This is as far

659
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:26,680
as I’ve got now with my reasoning.
&gt;&gt; But do you not dislike the way that’s

660
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:32,550
all of these actions might not be unconstitutional.
They’re not justified in constitutional

661
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:35,780
terms but in language such as extraordinary
rendition, emergency powers.

662
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:38,950
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yeah, I do dislike that very
much, yes. I mean, no one’s ever been able

663
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:43,150
to point out to me that Lincoln’s suspension
of habeas corpus helped to defeat the confederacy

664
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:47,579
for example. And I certainly don’t think
that the president has the right under the

665
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:51,540
constitution to suspend habeas corpus. Only
the Congress can do that. It doesn’t mean

666
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:55,480
it can’t be suspended. The Congress has
to do it, the president cannot. I'm rather

667
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,600
a stickler for that kind of thing. Call me
old fashioned if you will.

668
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:03,179
&gt;&gt; Well, I feel I’ve taken up a little too
much time now.

669
01:01:03,179 --> 01:01:04,700
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: A very welcome question, believe
me.

670
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:10,960
&gt;&gt; I would posit that the Bush administration
has restrained itself or needs to be restrained

671
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:15,420
from using genuine religious language in the
way it’s approached that so called war and

672
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:19,619
terror and I believe the word crusade was
used earlier in the campaign by President

673
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:23,980
Bush, it’s not been used since. And we remember
that the original name of the campaign was

674
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:31,180
infinite justice. Another rejected piece of
unfortunate language, obviously picked out

675
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:37,420
by some careful PR person.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: [INDISTINCT]

676
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:42,140
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you very much for coming. I was
just having a question about something that

677
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:46,280
many people have probably find to be a less
serious issue but I'm curious about your thoughts

678
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:52,089
on art, music and creativity and how those
fit in with your other ideas, those were three

679
01:01:52,089 --> 01:01:56,460
things that formed communities that maybe
we argued on faith, you know. The greatest

680
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:00,340
composers throughout history always dedicating
their work to God and things of that nature

681
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:06,029
and I'm just curious how you view these things
and beauty of these things to be similar to

682
01:02:06,029 --> 01:02:09,859
the beauty that you suggested you can find
in nature or how you think that they might

683
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:15,019
be more suited, more fitting in with religion.
I'm just curious if you think that any would

684
01:02:15,019 --> 01:02:17,830
be devalued in this new system or any—with
your ideas.

685
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:26,410
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yeah, we don’t know, of the
extraordinary buildings, the great Gothic

686
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:32,810
Cathedrals for example or the, even the Great
Mosques of Andalusia. We don’t know if the

687
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:37,920
architects who built them that they were themselves
convinced that it was for the greater glory

688
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,089
of God. We just know that at the time you
couldn't get a job as an architect if you

689
01:02:42,089 --> 01:02:46,559
didn't affirm that. And certainly we know
what would have happened to you if you said,

690
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:51,000
“What God?” That would not just be the
end of your career as an architect, so we

691
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,650
don’t know that about... We don’t know
the same about, even the devotional painters,

692
01:02:55,650 --> 01:03:04,109
we don’t know if they were believers, or
the composers. Of the devotional poets, and

693
01:03:04,109 --> 01:03:08,049
I'm on stronger ground here as a literary
critic, I know a bit more about it. People

694
01:03:08,049 --> 01:03:12,359
like John Donne or George Herbert, it would
be very, very hard to fake writing that if

695
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:16,460
you weren’t a believer. It would be extremely
hard, where would you get your inspiration

696
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:20,869
from? And my feeling is that it’s real devotional
poetry and I personally couldn't be without

697
01:03:20,869 --> 01:03:30,579
it. We’d be much poorer. To stay with the
literature if you don’t mind. The King James

698
01:03:30,579 --> 01:03:34,869
version of the bible, the King James translation,
referred to in the New York Times recently

699
01:03:34,869 --> 01:03:41,230
as the St. James translation, is itself a
great work of literature and one couldn't

700
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:45,260
be without it, if you don’t understand the
beauty of that liturgy, there’s a lot of

701
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:50,519
Shakespeare and of Milton and Blake you wouldn’t
get, you wouldn’t know what was going on.

702
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:58,010
So it’s part of literacy to know it. I once
wrote a book about the Parthenon, very important

703
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:03,839
building for western civilization, great deal
to be learned from it and from, by its beauty

704
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:10,589
and by its symmetry and by its extraordinary
architecture and sculpture. But I no longer

705
01:04:10,589 --> 01:04:16,809
care about the culture of Pallas Athena and
I don’t care about the mystical ceremonies,

706
01:04:16,809 --> 01:04:21,160
some of them involving animal sacrifice and
possibly human, that were conducted on the

707
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:25,890
road from Eleusis. And I don’t have to care
about Athenian imperialism and what it did

708
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:30,890
to the Greek colonies in the rest of the Mediterranean.
I can just appreciate the building and some—and

709
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:35,059
know about the philosophical context and the
plays of Sophocles and all the other things

710
01:04:35,059 --> 01:04:38,990
that were going on at the same time without
any reference to their gods. So I propose

711
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:44,490
that what culture largely means to us now
is how to deal with civilizational art and

712
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:52,240
great creativity in a post-supernatural era.
In other words, how to keep all of that that’s

713
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:57,789
of value without having to care about the
culture of Pallas Athena for example or to

714
01:04:57,789 --> 01:05:03,559
be forced to bear in mind that say, St. Peter’s
in Rome, actually not I think that impressive

715
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:08,369
a building, was built by special set of indulgences,
I mean that’s how the money for it was raised.

716
01:05:08,369 --> 01:05:13,430
We can consider that independently now. We
can value this building without knowing that.

717
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:15,451
Though I always find it’s somewhat hard
to forget.

718
01:05:15,451 --> 01:05:22,119
&gt;&gt; Right. Okay. I was just curious, I mean
I wanted to seek more towards how all these

719
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:27,780
things in art and music and creativity are
often relayed between individuals as being

720
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:33,259
spiritual or something along that nature whether
or not the actual topic.

721
01:05:33,259 --> 01:05:40,799
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: I wanted to say a bit more of
this when I was speaking first. I think that

722
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:46,589
the human need for the transcendent, for the
spiritual is undeniable but that’s not the

723
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:51,529
supernatural. It’s very important to understand.
The feeling that people get out of landscape

724
01:05:51,529 --> 01:05:58,849
and music, or landscape and music in combination.
The feeling of war and love at the same time

725
01:05:58,849 --> 01:06:06,040
has had extraordinary consequences for many
people, or one or other on their own. These

726
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:09,230
are the things we can’t do without but there’s
no reason to attribute them to the supernatural.

727
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:12,449
You’re not glimpsing anything but nature
from that.

728
01:06:12,449 --> 01:06:17,860
&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Hi. So it turns out if you follow the money

729
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:22,460
trail back for a lot of these things, this
whole creationism, teaching creationism idea,

730
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:27,839
you’ll eventually find political organizations
that are trying to energize a base, right,

731
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:28,839
these bases...
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Yes.

732
01:06:28,839 --> 01:06:32,079
&gt;&gt; What they’d like to do is to get these
people to feel like they’re being attacked.

733
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:36,630
And in lot of the discussions we have in your
presentation, there’s a fine line between

734
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:42,390
attacking people versus attacking ideas, right?
What do you do to kind of ensure that you’re

735
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:46,599
not going after people and not making people
feel like you’re telling them that they’re

736
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:49,800
idiots for example? All right. How do you
make that separation?

737
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:58,119
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: Well, I think my answer’s been
anticipated perhaps.

738
01:06:58,119 --> 01:07:00,630
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: If someone tells me that I’ve

739
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:03,119
hurt their feelings I’m still waiting to
hear what your point is.

740
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,530
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: I'm very depressed that in this

741
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:13,319
country you can be told that’s offensive
as if those two words constitute an argument

742
01:07:13,319 --> 01:07:16,789
or comment, not to me they don’t, and I'm
not running for anything. So, I didn't have

743
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:22,040
to pretend to like people when I don’t.
&gt;&gt; Right. Thanks.

744
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:30,839
&gt;&gt; Hello. Oh, thank you so much for speaking.
I think we’re going to have a book signing

745
01:07:30,839 --> 01:07:36,280
right outside over here. So, if everyone got
their copy of the book, thank you very much

746
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,270
for coming.
&gt;&gt; HITCHENS: How very nice of you.
