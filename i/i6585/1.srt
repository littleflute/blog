00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
- Welcome to the Cybertruck unveil.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,660
(crowd cheering)<br>We've created an exoskeleton.

3
00:00:07,819 --> 00:00:13,187
(bangs) (laughs) (cheering)

4
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:16,987
Nice.<br>Now, hit the Cybertruck.

5
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:22,306
(bangs)<br>(crowd cheering)

6
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:26,854
Yeah, what else can we do<br>with this truck, let's shoot it?

7
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:31,373
That's a nine millimeter bullet shot at the door.

8
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:41,134
So, it's ultra hard, cold rolled,<br>stainless steel alloy that we've developed.<br>We're gonna be using the same alloy<br>in the star ship rocket and in the Cybertruck.

9
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:43,683
Let's show the glass demo.

10
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:47,923
So, first this is regular glass,<br>this is like normal glass, car glass.

11
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:52,523
We're going to show you what happens<br>with normal car glass.

12
00:00:53,170 --> 00:01:01,260
(thuds)<br>Now, I'll show you Tesla Armor Glass.<br>(crowd cheers)<br>Yeah.

13
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,969
(thuds)<br>(mumbles)

14
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:08,090
Alright France, could you try to break this glass, please?<br>

15
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:13,379
(crowd cheers for France)

16
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:16,198
Yeah.<br>

17
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,097
- You sure?

18
00:01:18,296 --> 00:01:19,646
- [Elon] Yeah.

19
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:20,766
(glass shatters)

20
00:01:20,937 --> 00:01:23,237
 Oh, my ...<br>Well,

21
00:01:23,436 --> 00:01:27,916
maybe that was a little too hard.<br>- Yeah.<br>(laughing)

22
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:34,805
- Man, should we try the rear?<br>- Let's try. - Yeah.<br>(crowd commenting)

23
00:01:35,043 --> 00:01:40,353
- It didn't go through. - That's true.<br>- So, that's a plus side.<br>- Let's try the rear.<br>- Try that one, really, okay, sure.

24
00:01:40,872 --> 00:01:46,892
(glass shatters) (laughter)<br>- Aww man!<br>- It didn't go through.<br>(laughing)

25
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:52,262
All right.<br>(crowd commenting)<br>Ah, not bad.

26
00:01:52,512 --> 00:02:00,091
(laughing)<br>A little room for improvement.<br>(laughing)<br>Anyway, in addition the car has an adaptive air suspension.

27
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:08,128
The rear is a 100 cubic feet, six and a half foot length,<br>bed length, up to 3500 pounds of pay load.

28
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:12,370
(cheering)

29
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,840
So, let's see on-road performance.

30
00:02:19,146 --> 00:02:24,046
(crowd commenting and exclaiming)

31
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:29,647
In terms of off-road performance,<br>it's gonna have the best angular, approach angle,

32
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:32,356
best clearance heights, best departure angle.

33
00:02:32,414 --> 00:02:38,685
People are really going off road<br>this is going to be great, you could basically<br>do the Baja Rally in this thing.

34
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:46,232
We have three ranges.<br>(clapping and cheering)

35
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:48,782
So, obviously they'll have access to all the super chargers.

36
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:54,701
Be capable of more than 250 kilowatts,<br>we'll reveal the actual number later.

37
00:02:54,781 --> 00:03:00,071
And, it has onboard outlets for 110 and 220 volts.

38
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,461
And, as a little plus, because it's got an air suspension,

39
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:07,238
we can tap off the air suspension<br>so you have a pneumatic source,

40
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,168
 so you have a, yeah.

41
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:12,836
(crowd cheering and clapping)

42
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:15,288
Onboard air compressor.<br>Of course, it'll come with autopilot standard.

43
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:19,777
(crowd cheering)<br>Yeah.

44
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:26,686
And that's gonna--<br>(crowd roars, whistles)

45
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:32,234
That's the price without any incentives.<br>That's just like the price without any incentives.

46
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:35,532
Yup, so you can order now if you would like?

47
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:38,003
(crowd cheers)<br>Alright, thank you!<br>Oh wait!

48
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:47,841
We have,(crowd shouting)<br>we also made an ATV, so.

49
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:52,060
(crowd cheering)

50
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:54,560
(dramatic music)<br>(crowd cheers and comments)<br>(cheering)

51
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,579
So, after the air suspension, you can drop real low

52
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:27,959
and you go high on the other side, which pull as load bolt.

53
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:30,459
So, you got it load bolt, you've got a built-in ramp,

54
00:04:30,658 --> 00:04:32,959
so, you can take an ATV or dirt bike, whatever you want

55
00:04:33,158 --> 00:04:36,768
and load it on the back.

56
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:40,258
(slides)<br>(clicks)

57
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:44,656
Yes.<br>Oh,<br>(crowd cheering)

58
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:50,575
and it's currently plugged in and charging.

59
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:52,965
Alright. Thank you.<br>(crowd cheers)

60
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,285
Oh, I should say also, we're going<br>to be offering rides in this whole night.

61
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,724
(crowd cheering and whistling)

62
00:05:03,463 --> 00:05:07,154
Yeah, don't mind the glass.<br>(crowd laughs)
